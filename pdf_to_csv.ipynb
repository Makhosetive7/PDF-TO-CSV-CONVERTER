      "General guidelines\n",
      "Antimicrobials are the most over-used class of medicines worldwide and\n",
      "in Zimbabwe. Apart from the unnecessary cost and risk to the patient,\n",
      "overuse encourages development of resistant organisms, a problem\n",
      "that has proven serious and expensive in many countries. Antimicrobials\n",
      "should be used only in patients with likely bacterial illness requiring\n",
      "systemic therapy. In many cases anti-microbial medicines will initially be\n",
      "given “blind” or “empirically”, the choice being based on clinical\n",
      "suspicion without microbiological confirmation. Positive identification of\n",
      "the pathogen and anti-microbial susceptibility testing should be sought\n",
      "wherever possible as this will result in better and more cost-effective\n",
      "treatment.\n",
      "Principles of antimicrobial use\n",
      "1. Choice of agent should be based on factors such as spectrum of\n",
      "activity, anticipated efficacy, safety, previous clinical experience,\n",
      "cost, and potential for resistance. These will be influenced by the\n",
      "severity of illness and whether the medicine is to be used for\n",
      "prophylaxis, empirical therapy or therapy directed by identification\n",
      "of one or more pathogens.\n",
      "2. Prophylactic therapy should be restricted to the use of a limited\n",
      "range of agents of proven efficacy in invasive procedures with a\n",
      "high risk of infection or where the consequences of infection are\n",
      "disastrous. Most surgical prophylaxis should be parenteral and\n",
      "commence just before the procedure, continuing for no more than\n",
      "one or two doses after the end of the operation. The aim is to\n",
      "achieve high plasma and tissue levels at the time that\n",
      "contamination is most likely i.e. during the operation.\n",
      "3. Empirical therapy should be based on local epidemiological data\n",
      "on potential pathogens and their patterns of antibiotic susceptibility.\n",
      "Appropriate specimens for Gram stain, culture and sensitivity\n",
      "testing should be obtained before commencing antimicrobial\n",
      "therapy. Maintain a database of susceptibility profile in order to\n",
      "guide intelligent choice of empirical antibiotic therapy at regional\n",
      "and national patterns.\n",
      "4. Directed antimicrobial therapy for proven pathogens should\n",
      "include the most effective, least toxic, narrowest spectrum agent\n",
      "available. This practice reduces the problems associated with\n",
      "broad-spectrum therapy, that is, selection of resistant micro-\n",
      "organisms and superinfection.\n",
      "5. Choice of route should be determined by the site and severity of\n",
      "infection. It is important that topical antimicrobial therapy be\n",
      "restricted to a few proven indications, for example, eye infections\n",

      "General Principles\n",
      "A full assessment of the pain is essential.\n",
      "• Pain may be either acute (e.g. fractures, post-operative), or chronic (e.g.\n",
      "malignancy) and in each case should be graded as mild, moderate or\n",
      "severe.\n",
      "• Pain may occur at more than one site and the cause at each site may\n",
      "differ, and therefore may require different treatment.\n",
      "• The psychological state of the patient should be assessed. Anxiolytic\n",
      "and anti-depressant medication is seldom needed – the opportunity for\n",
      "discussion is more effective. If overlooked, underlying conditions –like\n",
      "anxiety, depression, social and spiritual distress - may aggravate pain,\n",
      "making control more difficult.\n",
      "• In acute pain, careful and frequent assessment is needed to determine\n",
      "the period for which medicines should be given. As the pain lessens,\n",
      "analgesics should be reduced and ultimately discontinued.\n",
      "• In chronic pain, long term analgesia is required. Frequent assessment is\n",
      "needed to establish the correct dose and minimise side effects of the\n",
      "medicines. Wherever possible analgesics should be given orally.\n",
      "Analgesics should be given at regular intervals to prevent recurrence of\n",
      "pain. Most preparations should be given every four hours. They should\n",
      "never be given on an “as required” basis – except when ‘break through’\n",
      "doses are added to an existing dose. [See management of severe pain\n",
      "in this chapter.]\n",
      "Mild Pain in Adults\n",
