" 2 General guidelines Antimicrobials are the most over-used class of medicines worldwide and in Zimbabwe. Apart from the unnecessary cost and risk to the patient, overuse encourages development of resistant organisms, a problem that has proven serious and expensive in many countries. Antimicrobials should be used only in patients with likely bacterial illness requiring systemic therapy. In many cases anti-microbial medicines will initially be given “blind” or “empirically”, the choice being based on clinical suspicion without microbiological confirmation. Positive identification of the pathogen and anti-microbial susceptibility testing should be sought wherever possible as this will result in better and more cost-effective treatment. Principles of antimicrobial use 1. Choice of agent should be based on factors such as spectrum of activity, anticipated efficacy, safety, previous clinical experience, cost, and potential for resistance. These will be influenced by the severity of illness and whether the medicine is to be used for prophylaxis, empirical therapy or therapy directed by identification of one or more pathogens. 2. Prophylactic therapy should be restricted to the use of a limited range of agents of proven efficacy in invasive procedures with a high risk of infection or where the consequences of infection are disastrous. Most surgical prophylaxis should be parenteral and commence just before the procedure, continuing for no more than one or two doses after the end of the operation. The aim is to achieve high plasma and tissue levels at the time that contamination is most likely i.e. during the operation. 3. Empirical therapy should be based on local epidemiological data on potential pathogens and their patterns of antibiotic susceptibility. Appropriate specimens for Gram stain, culture and sensitivity testing should be obtained before commencing antimicrobial therapy. Maintain a database of susceptibility profile in order to guide intelligent choice of empirical antibiotic therapy at regional and national patterns. 4. Directed antimicrobial therapy for proven pathogens should include the most effective, least toxic, narrowest spectrum agent available. This practice reduces the problems associated with broad-spectrum therapy, that is, selection of resistant micro-organisms and superinfection. 5. Choice of route should be determined by the site and severity of infection. It is important that topical antimicrobial therapy be restricted to a few proven indications, for example, eye infections because of the capacity of most agents to select resistant micro-"
   
" 3 organisms and to cause sensitisation; topical antiseptics are preferred in most situations. 6. Antimicrobial combinations have few indications. These include: § to extend the spectrum of cover, for example, in empirical therapy or in mixed infections, § to achieve a more rapid and complete bactericidal effect, for example, in enterococcal endocarditis, § to prevent the emergence of resistant micro-organisms, for example in the therapy of tuberculosis. Note: Doses given are for a 70kg adult with normal hepatic and renal function. Paediatric doses are given in the chapter on Paediatric Conditions. In the elderly, as a general rule, doses given could be lower than the recommended adult dose (see Chapter on Medicines and the Elderly). Notes on Specific Antimicrobials Note that some antibiotics are becoming ineffective because micro-organisms are generally resistant to them. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should therefore be sought where possible. Patients should be counselled to complete courses even when they feel better. Oral amoxicillin should be used in preference to oral ampicillin because of its better absorption, efficacy and lower cost. However, the same is not true of the injectable preparations that have similar efficacy. Chloramphenicol must be limited to serious infection such as typhoid, Klebsiella pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae infections, difficult to treat pelvic inflammatory disease and brain abscesses and not used indiscriminately in the treatment of fever. An exception to this is when a broad-spectrum antibiotic is required and there is a problem with availability. Furthermore, the oral preparation should be used judiciously as it is more prone to cause aplastic anaemia than the injectable formulation. Dosage of gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin (aminoglycosides) must be carefully adjusted for weight and renal function. Except for duration less than 3 days use or when lower doses are used, as with TB therapy, they require peak and trough serum levels (where available), careful monitoring of serum urea and/or creatinine, and checking for complaints of auditory or vestibular symptoms (adverse effects). Patients with true penicillin allergy (that is, a pruritic rash, angioedema or anaphylaxis) must not be given penicillin. Rashes occurring after 48 hours are rarely due to allergy and are not a contraindication to further use. Note that, penicillins have cross-reactivities with other medicines including cephalosporins and such newer medicines as imipenem. "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 4 Macrolides are suitable alternatives. Persons with a history of co-trimoxazole allergy may be offered desensitisation (see Chapter on HIV infections). Pyrexia/Fever of unknown origin Fever is a common presenting symptom at all ages, but in adults there will usually be some localising symptoms or signs, which point to a likely focus of infection. If after careful examination no clear focus of infection is identified, the following should be considered in a previously healthy patient admitted from the community with fever of less than two weeks’ duration: § Viral infections (frequently resolve after 4-5 days, or may be the prodromal phase, for example, hepatitis) § Malaria § Typhoid § Urinary tract infection § Bacteraemia § HIV related causes of fever If HIV infection is suspected see guidelines in the chapter on HIV Related Diseases. § If the patient’s general condition is satisfactory, it is reasonable to withhold antibiotics while carrying out a few basic investigations: that is urinalysis (dip-stick), urine microscopy, haemoglobin, white cell count and differential and malarial parasites which are all within the capabilities of a district hospital laboratory. If possible, send a blood culture to the nearest reference laboratory. Liver function tests and urine testing for bile products are appropriate if hepatitis is suspected. § If no improvement occurs after 3-4 days, and there is still no identifiable focus of infection, and there is no evidence of malaria (at least two negative blood films), the subsequent management of the patient should be guided by the results of the investigations. § In those patients who present very ill or toxic, or whose condition deteriorates, antibiotic therapy should be initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion (typhoid - chloramphenicol, staphylococcal septicaemia - cloxacillin, etc), anaerobes (metronidazole). Recommended ‘blind’ therapy for septicaemia with no identifiable source is as follows:   Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  ampicillin iv B E 2g 4 times a day Review and gentamicin iv C V 4–5mg /kg  once a day max 2 weeks "
   
" 5  Alternative:   Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  chloramphenicol iv  B E 1g 4 times a day Review and gentamicin iv C V 4–5mg /kg  once a day max 2 weeks  The use of antimicrobials for prophylaxis of infection There are some instances where the use of prophylactic antibiotics is well established. However, the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis of infection often consumes a disproportionate amount of all antibiotics used in the hospital setting and consideration to their appropriate use must be given. Prophylactic antibiotic use must be within accepted principles and guidelines. General Recommendations: § use the appropriate medicine (see below) § give as a single dose where possible § repeat when the procedure lasts longer than 3-4 hours § give intravenously 10-15 minutes before incision, or orally 1-2 hours before incision.

EDLIZ 2015   
" 8 General Notes  (See National Infection Control Guidelines) Transmission of infections in healthcare facilities can be prevented and controlled through the application of basic infection control prevention and control practices. The 2 tiers or categories of infection control prevention and practices are A) standard precautions and B) transmission based precautions.  The goal of this two- tier/category system is to minimise risk of infection and maximise safety level within our healthcare facilities. • Educate healthcare workers not only on what to do but why it is important to do it. • Emphasising outcomes helps healthcare workers see how their routine job duties interact with the infection control system. Categories of Infection Control Practices: a. Standard Precautions (previously known as Universal Precautions) - must be applied to all patients at all times, regardless of diagnosis or infectious status. b. Transmission based precautions - are specific to modes of transmission e.g. airborne, droplet or contact.   A) Standard Precautions Treating all patients in the healthcare facility with the same basic level of “standard” precautions involves work practices that are essential to provide a high level of protection to patients, healthcare workers and visitors. These precautions include the following: • Hand hygiene (hand washing, hand antisepsis) • Use of personal protective equipment when handling blood substances excretions and secretions. • Appropriate handling of patient care equipment and soiled linen. • Prevention of needle stick/sharp injuries. • Environmental cleaning and spills management. • Appropriate handling of waste.      "
   
" 9 Hand Hygiene Appropriate hand washing can minimise micro-organisms acquired on the hands by contact with body fluids and contaminated surfaces. Hand washing breaks the chain of infection transmission and reduces person to person transmission.  NB:  Hand washing or hand antisepsis is the simplest and most cost- effective way of preventing the transmission of infection and thus reducing the incidence of healthcare associated infections.  Types of Hand Hygiene  1. Hand washing is usually limited to hands and wrists, the hands are washed for a minimum 10-18 seconds with hand washing soap and water. 2. Hand antisepsis/Decontamination • Decontaminate hands with a waterless alcohol based hand gel or rub for 15-30 seconds. This is appropriate for hands that are not visibly soiled. 3. Surgical hand antisepsis • This removes or destroys transient micro-organisms and confers a prolonged effect. The hands and forearms are washed thoroughly with an antiseptic soap for a minimum 2-3 minutes and dried with a sterile towel. This is required before performing invasive procedures. NB: Hands should be dried with disposable paper towels.  Use of Personal Protective Equipment. Types: • Scrub Suit or Gowns • Plastic Aprons  • Boots or shoes covers • Caps  • Protective eye wear • Gloves  • Gloves Ø Reduce the incidence of hand contamination with infective material which in turn reduces the opportunity for personnel to become infected and/or the organisms to spread to other personnel and /or patients. Ø Gloves however should not replace hand washing.  "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 10 Gloves are to be worn when touching the following: • Blood • All body fluids • All body secretions • All body excretions Gloves should be removed before touching clean items (e.g. phone, door knobs or patients’ charts.) After removing gloves, wash hands thoroughly.  A. Important points to remember when using gloves.  • Use gloves when there is potential exposure to blood, body fluids, excretions or secretions. • Change gloves between patients, between procedures on the same patient when they become soiled. • Remove gloves before leaving the patient’s bedside and decontaminate hands immediately with 70% alcohol hand rub solution. • Discard gloves after attending to each patient.   B. Boots/shoe covers • These are used to protect the wearer from splashes of blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions. • Shoe covers should be disposable and waterproof. • Waterproof boots should be washable.  C. Caps • Disposable and waterproof caps that completely cover the hair are used when splashes of blood and body fluids are expected.  D. Masks 1. A surgical mask protects healthcare providers from inhaling respiratory pathogens transmitted by the droplet routes. It prevents the spread of infectious diseases such as varicella (Chicken pox) and meningococcal diseases (meningococcal meningitis.) 2. A N95 mask protects healthcare providers from inhaling respiratory pathogens that are transmitted via the airborne route. This helps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as TB, or MDR TB. NB: In order to prevent the spread of infection, the appropriate mask should be worn by healthcare providers and visitors when attending to a patient suffering from a communicable disease that is spread via the airborne or droplet route.  "
   
" 11 The patient with a communicable disease via the droplet or airborne route should wear a surgical mask when being transferred to other departments or hospitals or in isolation room to prevent spread of infection. Disposable masks are for single use only and should only be discarded after 4-6 hours use. Precautions a) Masks should not be worn around the neck b) Masks cannot be worn with beards or unshaven faces. c) Masks should completely seal the face at all times to ensure effective filtering of micro-organisms.  E. Gowns • Gowns made of impervious material are worn to protect the wearer’s clothing/uniform from possible contamination with micro-organisms and exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions. • Use gown once for one patient and discard. • Healthcare workers should remove gowns before leaving the unit. Recommendations for use of gowns • Lab coats or scrub suits should not be viewed as an effective barrier to blood or other body fluids. • Use of fluid resistant gowns, impervious gowns or plastic aprons, if soiling of clothes with blood or other potentially infectious material is likely, is highly recommended.    F. Plastic Aprons • A plastic apron protects the wearers’ uniform from contact with contaminated body fluids. • The inside of the apron is considered clean, the outside is considered contaminated. The neck of the apron is clean because that part is not touched with contaminated hands. • Wash hands thoroughly after removing apron.  Protective eyewear/Goggles • Should be worn at all times during patient contact where there is a possibility that  patients’ body fluids may splash or spray onto the care giver’s face/eyes (e.g. during suctioning, intubation, endoscopy and cleaning of instruments used for these procedures) • During all dental, surgical, laboratory and post mortem procedures. • Full face shields may also be used to protect the eyes and mouth of the healthcare worker in high risk situations. "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 12 • Re-usable goggles should be washed and decontaminated after removal and in-between use. Please note:  All protective equipment should be removed prior to leaving work area.  G. Needles, sharp instruments and other devices. All equipment contaminated with blood or other body fluids should be handled with special care. Keep in mind these recommendations: • Never recap needles • Never bend or break needles • Never remove needles from disposable syringes  • Immediately dispose of all disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp instruments, after use, in a colour-coded or labelled leak-proof puncture resistant container. B) Transmission based precautions. These are designed to supplement standard precautions or protocols and must always be used in conjunction with Standard Precautions isolation techniques. Transmission based precautions provide extra safety by facilitating a concerted effort to control the spread of specific types of bacteria. Whilst mostly used for diagnosed infection, they are useful when a specific diagnosis is suspected. Transmission based precautions are divided into 3 basic categories: Ø Contact Ø Droplet Ø Airborne  A. Contact Precautions: • Reduces the risk of transmission of organisms from infected or colonised patient through direct or indirect contact.(e.g. Herpes Simplex, Haemorrhagic Fever Virus e.g. Ebola, multi-drug resistant bacteria) • Precautions include: Hand gloving/Patient placement /Hand washing/Use of aprons and gowns/Patient care equipment/Patient transport   "
   
" 13 B. Droplet Precautions: • Reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission of pathogens spread by large droplets particles usually within a metre (e.g. Mumps, Diptheria, Haemophilus and Influenza.) • Droplets may be expelled during: Sneezing/Coughing/Talking • Teach cough hygiene i.e. cover mouth when coughing • Precautions include: Patient Placement/Respiratory protection/Patient transportation.  C. Airborne Precautions: • Designed to provide protection from extremely tiny airborne bacteria or dust particles which may be suspended in the air for an extended period of time. • Used in addition to Standard Precautions for patients known or suspected to be infected with micro-organisms transmitted by airborne route e.g. TB, chicken pox/measles. • Precautions include: Respiratory Protection/Patient placement/Patient transportation  "

"  15  General Notes: The content of this chapter reflects the major causes of infant mortality and morbidity in Zimbabwe – prematurity, neonatal sepsis, perinatal asphyxia, acute respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, malnutrition and, immunisable diseases. Some of the paediatric conditions may have underlying HIV infection.  Other paediatric conditions have been described in the relevant chapters in EDLIZ, and where possible paediatric doses have been given.  § Note: doses are also given by age and weight wherever possible, and volumes of liquids or injections to be administered are indicated. Always check the concentration of the preparation however, as preparations may change. This should not be seen as a ‘short-cut’ to calculating the proper dose. Neonatal Conditions Medicine Dosage for Infants Under 1 Month During the first month of life absorption, metabolism and excretion in a baby are not yet fully developed. For this reason the frequency of medicine dosing is based on gestational age and not on the characteristics of the medicine.  The table below gives the frequency of dosing for all medicines and is referred to in the therapies that follow in the text.  Table 3.1 Frequency of dosage by gestational age  For example: Benzyl penicillin dose 100,000u/kg/dose (0.1MU/kg) Thus a 2kg pre-term baby 5 days old would receive 200,000u Benzyl penicillin  every 12hours, whilst a 2kg term baby 5 days old would receive 200,000u every 8 hours. Routine Management at Birth § Do not suction mouth routinely, only if there is something (e.g. thick meconium) to suck out. Gestational age > 37 weeks (term baby) First two days 2 doses per 24 hours 3 days to 2 weeks 3 doses per 24 hours > 2 weeks 4 doses per 24 hours Gestational age < 37 weeks (pre-term baby) First week 2 doses per 24 hours 1-4 weeks 3 doses per 24 hours > 4 weeks 4 doses per 24 hours NB: Not for gentamicin- see table 3.2 "

See management algorithm on the next page  Feeding and Fluids In general, babies should breast-feed on demand from birth. There is no need for supplemental water or other feeds. For babies requiring special care (low birth weight, birth asphyxia, infection, etc) the following fluid regimen based on birth weight is recommended: Oral feeds § Day 1: 60ml per kg per 24 hrs.

" 26 Paediatric Conditions Common paediatric conditions such as acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhoea, child with fever (axillary temperature 37.5oC and above); severe malnutrition (PEM) are now incorporated in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI).  General guidelines on the use of antibiotics Paediatric doses are given in Tables 2.6 and 2.7 (Neonatal doses are given separately in Table 2.3) § ALWAYS DO BLOOD CULTURES IN SUSPECTED SEPSIS. § supportive measures are often more important than antibiotics themselves: for example, fluids in diarrhoea and vomiting; § antibiotics should be given in the full dosage appropriate for the age and weight of the child; dosage is best calculated according to body weight up to 40kg (do not exceed the adult dose); § change to oral administration wherever possible (except for meningitis); benzylpenicillin intramuscularly/ intravenously can be changed to procaine penicillin intramuscularly (if response is good) once child is afebrile.  Check for General Danger Signs:   Ask: § if the child is not able to drink or breastfeed § if the child is vomiting everything § if the child has had convulsions § if there are periods of not breathing Look to see: § If the child is lethargic or unconscious. A child with any general danger sign needs urgent attention. Acute Respiratory Infections Check for any general danger signs (above). Any history of fever in a falciparum malaria area: § take a blood slide § treat for malaria (see chapter on Malaria) Fever for more than 5 days: refer for assessment. "
   
"  27 In areas with falciparum malaria, a child with pneumonia and a fever of 37.5°C or more (or a history of fever) may need an antibiotic for pneumonia and an anti-malarial for malaria. Management of a child with cough/difficult breathing Note: Antihistamines and sedating cough mixtures MUST NOT be used in managing respiratory infections. Breast milk, warm drinks including water, and fruit are effective cough /sore throat relievers. Pneumonia is recognised by difficulty in breathing which is either fast breathing or chest indrawing.  Table 3.4: definition of fast breathing: Age: Fast breathing is defined as: < 2 months 60 breaths per minute 2 months to 12 months 50 breaths per minute 12 months to 5 years 40 breaths per minute Chest indrawing is when the lower part of the chest moves in when the child breathes in.  Grunting is a soft short sound that the infant makes when breathing out. Table 3.5: Management of pneumonia: SIGNS CLASSIFY AS: TREATMENT Urgent pre-referral treatments  are in bold print Any general danger sign or chest indrawing or stridor in a calm child Severe pneumonia  or  very severe disease Ø Give first dose of an appropriate antibiotic Ø Treat to prevent low blood sugar (see below) Ø Keep the child warm Ø Treat wheeze if present Ø Refer URGENTLY to hospital Fast breathing Pneumonia Ø Give an appropriate antibiotic for 5 days Ø Treat wheeze if present Ø Advise mother to return immediately if condition worsens Ø Follow-up in 2 days No signs of pneumonia or of very severe disease No pneumonia: cough or cold Ø If coughing more than 21 days, refer for assessment Ø Treat wheeze if present Ø Advise mother to return immediately if condition worsens Ø Follow-up in 7 days if not improving "

" 28 Management of severe pneumonia: The major cause of pneumonia is infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilis influenzae. These respond well to the antibiotics recommended below if recognised early.  Note: Paediatric dose starts at 2 months in IMNCI. For babies 1-2 months check for the neonatal doses. § Well nourished children over 6 months with severe pneumonia can be managed with benzylpenicillin only. § Give first dose of intramuscular benzylpenicillin and gentamicin and refer child urgently to hospital.  § If referral not possible repeat the benzylpenicillin 6 hourly and gentamicin once daily.

" 44 Acute malnutrition (Marasmus and Kwashiorkor)  Growth monitoring Regular weight and height measurements during growth monitoring are very important to assess the nutritional status of each child.  Growth faltering Refers to a child whose weight remains static or is going down on 3 consecutive monthly weighing.  Low-weight-for-age refers to the weight for age below -2 SD on child health card. § Counselling of the mother should start from the time loss of weight or static weight is identified.  n If no improvement by the third consecutive month, the child should be referred. n Check for malnutrition and anaemia – see chart below.  Table 3.9: Classification of acute, moderate and severe malnutrition in children Age Group Measurement Index Classification Severe Acute Malnutrition Moderate Acute Malnutrition Children Less than  6 Months  Classify severe if presence of any of the following:  • Bilateral pitting oedema • Weight for Length ≤ SD (WHO) • Infant too weak or feeble to suckle effectively  • Mother reports breastfeeding failure AND infant is not  gaining weight at home Children 6 to 59 Months  Weight for Height (W/H) ≤3 SD (WHO) ≤2 & ≥3 SD (WHO) Mid-upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) <115 mm ≥ 115 mm&<125 mm Bilateral Pitting Oedema Yes No Children and Adolescents (5 to 18 Years ) Body Mass Index (BMI) for Age ≤3 SD (WHO) OR visible wasting ≤2 & ≥3 SD (WHO) Bilateral pitting  oedema Yes No "
   
" 45 Acute malnutrition and complications( See latest National Protocols) Patients with severe or moderate acute malnutrition AND complications should be admitted for inpatient care. Complications should be managed according to national protocols for different age groups.    Routine Medicines to Accompany Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding  Provide routine medicines in both Phases I and II per national protocol as appropriate for age and complications of patient. Treatment of hypoglycemia in Severe Acute Malnutrition  Hypoglycemia and hypothermia usually occur together and are signs of infection. Check for hypoglycemia whenever hypothermia (axillary<35.0oC; rectal<35.5oC) is found. Frequent feeding is important in preventing both conditions.  If the child is conscious and has hypogylcemia give:  Medicine Codes Child Dose        Frequency Duration 10% glucose solution Or 10% sucrose solution C    E 50ml bolus Once  Then F-75  C    E 3ml/kg/Feed Every 30 minutes 2 hours 11ml/kg/Feed 2 hourly 2 days The glucose or sucrose solution (1 rounded teaspoon of sugar in 3.5 tablespoons water), can be given orally or by nasogastric (NG) tube.  If the child is unconscious, lethargic or convulsing give IV sterile 10% glucose (5ml/kg), followed by 50ml of 10% glucose or sucrose by Ng tube. Then give starter F-75. Treatment of Infection in Severe malnourished children The usual signs of infection, such as fever, and infections are often absent in severe malnutrition. Therefore, presume infection in severe malnutrition and give routinely broad-spectrum antibiotic(s) AND measles vaccine if child is > 6months and not immunized (delay if the child is in shock).  "

Treatment of dehydration in Severe Malnourished Children Severe acute malnourished children with profuse watery diarrhoea and signs such as sunken eyes, slow skin pinch, absent tears, dry mouth, very thirsty, reduced urine output, rapid pulse and respirations. These should be considered as severely dehydrated.  Do not use the IV route for rehydration except in cases of shock and then do so with care, infusing slowly to avoid flooding the circulation and overloading the heart. Do not give standard oral rehydration salts solution (90 mmol sodium/l) to severely malnourished children as it contains too "
   
 47 much sodium and too little potassium. Give special Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition (ReSoMal).  
"Replace the ReSoMal doses at 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours with F-75 if rehydration is continuing at these times, then continue feeding with F-75  When ReSoMal is not available prepare as follows: Ingredient Amount Water (boiled & cooled) 2 litres WHO-ORS One 1 litre-packet* Sugar 50 g Combined Vitamin and Mineral mix (CMV)* 3g If CMV* is not available, Electrolyte/mineral solution can be prepared as follows: Quantity grams molar content of 20 ml Potassium Chloride: KCl   224 24 mmol Tripotassium Citrate: C6H5K3O7.H2O 81 2 mmol Magnesium Chloride: MgCl2.6H2O 76 3 mmol Zinc Acetate: Zn(CH3COO)2.2H20 8.2 300 μmol Copper Sulphate: CuSO4.5H2O 1.4 45 μmol Water: Make up to 2500 ml Weigh the ingredients and make up to 2500 ml.

Properly cover the child with clothes, including a hat, and blankets. The child must be dried "
   
" 49 immediately and properly after bathing. Bath time should be minimal and, done during the day. n Attempt to incorporate an educational message into each intervention. n Intravenous infusions should be avoided except when essential, as for severe dehydration with shock or septic shock. n Intramuscular injections should be given with care in the thigh, using the smallest possible gauge needle and volume of fluid. n The room temperature should be kept at 28-32 degrees Celsius. This will seem uncomfortably warm for active, fully clothed staff, but is necessary for small, immobile children who easily become hypothermic. n Those children who do not need emergency treatment for complications should be admitted directly to outpatient therapeutic programme (OTP) and started on Ready to Use (RTU) feed e.g. plumpy nut,  as soon as possible.(refer to nutrition guidelines) Therapeutic Feeding The therapeutic diet for malnourished children consists of two formulas, F-75 and F-100 or Ready to use Therapeutic Food (RUTF). F-75 (75 kcal/100 ml), is used during the initial phase of treatment, while F-100 or RUTF (100 kcal/100 ml) is used during the rehabilitation phase, after the appetite has returned.   Table 3.9 Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Recommendations (Phase 1)  Phase 1 (Stabilization care) Age Group Product and Prescription Children <6 Months • Give Diluted F-100 at 130 ml/kg of body weight per day • Breastfed children should always be offered breast milk before the therapeutic milk, and always on demand Children 6 to 59 Months • Give F-75 at 130 ml per kg of body weight per day until the patient re-gains appetite.  • Start with 2 hourly feeds (12 feeds per day), and gradually decrease the frequency of feeding and increase the volume of each feed until the patient is getting 3-hourly feeds (8 feeds per day)   "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 50 In the stabilization phase give F75 formula as above. These provide 130ml/kg/day. If there is oedema, reduce the volume to 100 ml/kg/day. Give F-75 from a cup or from a spoon, dropper or syringe if the child is very weak feed. If the appetite is poor, coax and encourage the patient to finish the feed.  If intake does not reach 105ml /kg/day despite frequent feeds, coaxing and re-offering, use a nasogastric tube. If the child is breastfed, encourage continued breastfeeding but also give prescribed amounts of F75 to make sure the child’s needs are met. Transfer to F100 formula as soon as appetite has returned (usually within 7days) and oedema has subsided.   Table 3.10 Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Recommendations (Phase 2) Phase 2 (Transition and Rehabilitation) Age Group Product and Prescription Children <6 Months • Give twice the volume offered during phase I Children 6 to 59 Months • Replace F75 with F-100 at 150ml per kg of body weight per day  • Gradually introduce RUTF in small amounts until  the child  can consume ¾ Sachet per day • When accepted, provide RUTF at 130kcal per kg of body weight per day In the rehabilitation phase a vigorous approach to feeding is required to achieve very high intakes and rapid weight gain of >10 g gain/kg/d. The recommended milk-based F-100 contains 100 kcal and 2.9 g protein/100 ml.  Readiness to enter the rehabilitation phase is signalled by a return of appetite, usually about one week after admission. A gradual transition is recommended to avoid the risk of heart failure which can occur if children suddenly consume huge amounts. To change from F75 to F100 formula replace F-75 with the same amount of F- 100 for 48 hours then, increase each successive feed by 10 ml until some feed remains uneaten. The point when some remains unconsumed is likely to occur when intakes reach about 30 ml/kg/feed (200 ml/kg/d). F-100 can be replaced by an alternative Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) once the appetite has returned. If commercial formulas F75 and F100 are not available, prepare as follows. DO NOT USE HIGH ENERGY MILK.  "

For young children, continue breastfeeding on demand. • RUTF is a food and medicine for children with Kwashiorkor or Marasmus only. It should not be shared. • Children with Kwashiorkor or Marasmus often do not like to eat. Give small regular meals of RUTF and encourage the child to eat often (if possible eight meals a day).  • Always offer the child plenty of cooled, boiled water to drink while he or she is eating RUTF. • Keep food clean and covered. Hygienic food handling and preparation. Use soap for children’s hands and face before feeding. Wash hands with soap and water after visiting the toilet. • Children with Kwashiorkor or Marasmus get cold quickly. Always keep the child covered and warm. • When a child has diarrhoea, never stop feeding. Give extra food and extra clean water. As soon as the child gets better, introduce the fortified, family type diet. "

" 53 Paediatric HIV infection  See Latest National Guidelines on Antiretroviral Therapy.Also refer to Chapters 8 and 9 here. Paediatric HIV infection can be significantly reduced by implementing an effective PMTCT program. Symptomatic HIV infection may be difficult to distinguish from other childhood conditions such as respiratory infections, diarrhoea and malnutrition. Suspect HIV related disease if two or more of the following signs are present: n severe or recurrent pneumonia n generalised lymphadenopathy n hepato-splenomegaly n failure to thrive n severe/recurrent oro-pharyngeal candidiasis. n finger clubbing In the majority of cases, the route of transmission is from mother to child. Ensure pre-test counselling of parents/caregivers before testing the child for HIV infection. Antibody detection tests are not diagnostic of true infection before 18 months due to persistence of maternal antibodies in the child. Prior to the age of 18 months, a DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for HIV is now being used i.e. DBS testing. General Guidelines for HIV care in children § Nutrition: advise the caregiver on high calorie diet and other essential nutrients for the child. Safe food and water practices § Hydration: oral rehydration, together with dietary advice is most important in the management of persistent diarrhoea. Intravenous fluids may be needed during severe diarrhoeal episodes. § Immunisation: BCG should be given to all children at birth. Immunisation is contraindicated only where there is symptomatic HIV infection. The current recommendation is to give the other live vaccines, measles and oral poliomyelitis vaccine even in immune-compromised children. [See chapter on Immunisation.] § Home care: is preferable to hospital admission for chronic care. § Counselling: the family will require support in facing the emotional and financial demands of the child’s chronic ill health as well as those arising from the parents’ own HIV status. Facilitate access to OI clinics.  Management of Specific HIV related Conditions Bacterial infections  "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 54 In the HIV infected child infections are likely to be more frequent, of longer duration with a poorer response to treatment. Septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia and abscesses frequently occur before any other features of HIV infection are evident. The causative organisms, however, are likely to be similar to those found in non-HIV-infected children and the standard guidelines on the choice of antibiotics apply. (However, in a child with severe pneumonia where Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is suspected, a course of high dose cotrimoxazole (60mg/kg every 8hrs) is indicated. Once a child is diagnosed as having HIV-related pneumonia cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be commenced:   Medicine Codes Paed dose Freq. Duration  cotrimoxazole po C V < 6mths 6-12mths >1 year = 120mg = 240mg = 480mg once a day for life There is an increased risk of tuberculosis infection in the HIV infected child. Where TB is confirmed, or with a diagnosis of probable TB, use the anti-TB treatment regimens recommended in the Chapter on Tuberculosis. Recurrent/ persistent diarrhoea: current evidence suggests that no single pathogen is responsible for the persistence of episodes of diarrhoea (>14 days). Follow the diarrhoea management guidelines in the section on diarrhoea. Chronic otitis media, oral candidiasis, eczema/ papular rash, and anaemia, may be related to HIV infection but are managed according to standard guidelines. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) is more commonly seen, presenting after the first year of life. Short term steroids have been used with good effect in children with severe respiratory symptoms. Give first dose of antibiotic (see management of pneumonia) and refer for specialist diagnosis.

Further information on immunisation, the cold chain etc, may be found in the Manual for the Zimbabwe Expanded Programme on Immunisation (ZEPI). Information relating to rabies can be found in the chapter on tropical diseases. Adverse events §  All adverse events following immunisation should be reported using the ‘Adverse Events Following Immunisation’ (AEFI) form. Health workers should refer to the ZEPI AEFI guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures. Diseases Preventable by Immunisation § Diphtheria § Measles § Rubella § Hepatitis B  § Pertussis (whooping cough) § Poliomyelitis § Rabies § Tetanus § Tuberculosis § Some pneumonias, septicaemia and meningitis (caused by Haemophilus Influenza type B  and Streptococcus pneumoniae) § Diarrhoea, vomiting and systematic upset due to Rotavirus infection. § Cancer caused by Human Papilloma Virus infection. Open vial policy § Open vials of DPT, DPT-HepB-Hib (Pentavalent), DT, TT, OPV, HPV and HepB may be used in subsequent sessions for a maximum of 28 days (ZEPI Policy) provided the vaccine has not expired, the VVM has not reached the discard point, the vial has not been contaminated, the vaccine has been kept in appropriate cold chain condition.  § Reconstituted vials of measles, BCG and HPV vaccines must be discarded as per manufacturer’s instructions or at the end of the session whichever comes first. Effectiveness of Vaccines in HIV Infected Individuals EPI recommended vaccines have shown satisfactory sero-conversion rates in early stages of HIV infection.  However the proportion of responders decreases with progression from HIV infection to AIDS. "
   
" 61 • Children with known or asymptomatic HIV infection should receive all EPI vaccines according to the schedule. • BCG vaccine should not be given to children with clinical symptoms of HIV infection. IMMUNISATION SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN  See Table 4.1. This schedule is the only schedule to be used in Zimbabwe. Ages given are minimum ages for each vaccination. Children should receive doses at these stated ages or at the first contact after reaching that age (maximum age limits are: BCG 11 months, Rotavirus 32 weeks, and Pentavalent 23 months). § Always check the dosage instructions in the manufacturer’s information supplied with the vaccine, as the strength may vary between manufacturers. § Always remember to record the batch number of the vaccine on the child’s health card when entering the date of immunisation. § Always ensure that the emergency box is available and is stocked with appropriate emergency medicines.

" 64 Tetanus Immunisations for Adults An adult woman with a complete course of childhood immunisations including boosters should need only one booster dose of tetanus toxoid vaccine, (recommended at first pregnancy) which should protect for life.

In pregnancy TT3 to be given at least 6months after TT2. 3 primary course DPT + 1 booster DPT (18 months) 2 doses one year apart 3 primary course DPT + 1 DPT booster + 1 DT booster (5 years) 1 dose NB: WHO has recommended that countries switch from tetanus toxoid containing vaccines (TT) to tetanus-diptheria vaccine (Td), but Zimbabwe has not adopted this policy yet. Immunisation details for available vaccines § Always check the dosage instructions in the manufacturer’s information supplied with the vaccine as strengths may vary. § In the event of a measles epidemic, children between 6 and 9 months can be vaccinated. However the measles vaccination must be repeated again after 9 months and another dose at 18 months. § The minimum interval for HB2 and HB3 is 5 months, if given as a mono dose. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO VACCINATIONS There are very few absolute contraindications to vaccines.  . Fever, diarrhoea, mild respiratory infection and malnutrition are not contraindications to vaccines. "
   
" 65 • BCG vaccine should not be given to a child with symptomatic HIV infection but polio and measles/rubella vaccines should be given to children with HIV and AIDS together with other vaccines. • A second or third dose of Pentavalent and DTP at 18 months should not be given to a child who severely reacted to a previous dose of Pentavalent (Note DTP because of the whole cell Pertussis may cause severe anaphylaxis, collapse, or convulsions). DT should be given instead. • A child with an evolving neurological disease such as uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy should not be given Pentavalent or DTP. Give DT instead. NB: The current DPT contains whole cell pertussis. INTERVAL BETWEEN MULTI-DOSES OF THE SAME ANTIGEN • The minimum interval between doses is 28 days. • If any dose of an antigen for subsequent doses is delayed, vaccinations on the next   attendance should be continued as if the usual interval had elapsed (i.e. 4 weeks have elapsed).   All the EPI antigens are safe and effective when administered simultaneously i.e. during the same vaccination session but on different sites.  Pentavalent, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus, IPV and OPV are given simultaneously. • If a vaccine dose is given at less than the recommended 28 days interval, it should not be counted as a valid dose and therefore should be repeated at the appropriate interval of 28 days from the previous dose. This applies to vaccines given during campaigns such as child health days, national immunisation days or in reaction to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases.   HOSPITAL ADMISSION POLICY ON IMMUNISATION • To reduce nosocomial transmission, Measles vaccine should be given on admission to all children six months to 15 years. This admission dose must be recorded on the graph side of the child health card corresponding with the age at which it was given and written vertically. If the child is 9 months and receives the first dose on admission this is charted on the appropriate section of the card. • Health workers should ascertain the vaccination status for all admitted children including those without a child health card and give the appropriate antigens.  • Children who are very ill on admission should be vaccinated as soon as their condition has improved."

" 67  General Note: Medicines should be avoided if at all possible throughout pregnancy, and especially during the first trimester. However, medicines may be required for a number of conditions commonly encountered during pregnancy; medicines which are appropriate and safe are covered in the sections that follow. At the end of the chapter is a list of those medicines which should be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy or lactation. Hormonal Contraception Important: Ensure a free and informed choice by providing counselling on the advantages and disadvantages of contraceptive methods. Oral, injectable and implants do not protect against HIV. For added protection there is need to use a ‘barrier’ contraceptive such as a male condom, a female condom or diaphragm.  Hormonal contraception only is covered in brief here. Comprehensive guidelines are provided by the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC); follow these wherever possible. Instructions for use, contraindications etc, are also found in the manufacturers' package inserts. Checklist for those not trained in family planning:  Before prescribing oral contraceptives ask the following questions. If answers to all these questions are ‘no’, the woman may be given any oral contraceptives. If any of the answers are ‘yes’, a doctor must first see her. n History of severe leg pain or swelling of calf? n History of sugar in urine? n History of yellow eyes or skin? n Severe chest pain? n Unusual shortness of breath after walking or light work? n Severe headaches (not relieved by headache tablets)? n Bleeding between periods or after sexual intercourse? n Missed a menstrual period? n Missed a menstrual period, and then started bleeding? n Very heavy menstrual periods? n Increased frequency of menstrual periods? n History of mental disturbances? n Goitre or history of goitre? n 35 years of age and over? n Painful varicose veins? n Had any surgical operation within last 2 weeks? "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 68 n Previous treatment for high blood pressure? n History of epilepsy? Oral Contraceptives IMPORTANT: Instruct the woman to always inform the doctor or nurse that she is taking oral contraceptives when she attends a clinic or hospital. Encourage clients to have a check up every two years or when she develops a problem. Ensure that the supplies given to the woman allow her to have an extra pack of pills always available. Also provide a supply of condoms with the first pack of pills for additional protection if the client is not menstruating. Encourage use of condoms as well to protect against STIs especially HIV. Oral contraceptives fall into two main categories. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)  These contain synthetic oestrogen and progestogen. Those with oestrogen content 30-35 micrograms (as ethinyloestradiol) are ‘low dose’ while those containing 50 micrograms of oestrogen are referred to as ‘high dose’. Taken daily they inhibit ovulation. ‘Triphasic pills’ contain phased levels to more closely mimic normal cyclical hormonal activity. The lower oestrogen dose pills have fewer side effects than higher dose pills (notably, reduced risk of thrombo-embolism) while maintaining a high rate of effectiveness. Menstruation on COCs will be regular and light. Progestogen only pills (POPs)  These contain synthetic progestogen e.g. norethisterone or norgestrel. Progestogens protect against pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus. This type is particularly suitable for lactating mothers.  Menstrual irregularities are a more common side effect. CAUTION: Progestogen Only Pills have a significant failure rate in non-lactating women. They should be taken at the same time each day. Conditions warranting withdrawal of oral contraceptives § pregnancy or suspected pregnancy § severe headaches especially associated with visual disturbances § numbness or paresis of extremities § unexplained vaginal bleeding § suspected or known carcinoma of the breast § known liver tumour "
   
" 69 § unexplained chest pain or shortness of breath § severe leg pains; § development of any of the absolute contra-indications mentioned in the manufacturer’s information sheet. Medicines Interactions with Oral Contraceptives Medicines reducing the effect of oral contraceptives Caution is needed when prescribing any of the following medicines to any woman taking oral contraceptives; they reduce the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive and pregnancy is more likely: • Anti-convulsants: carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone. • Antibacterials: rifampicin If the medicine is only going to be used for a short time the woman should be advised to take extra contraceptive precautions for the duration of the therapy, and seven days after treatment, for example, condoms or abstinence from intercourse. If the medicine is to be used on a long-term basis the woman should be advised to use another suitable method of contraception. Medicines which are made less effective by oral contraceptives Doses of particular medicines may need to be increased, with careful monitoring: § Anticoagulants § Anti-convulsants (phenytoin) § Antidepressants (imipramine) § Anti-hypertensive agents (methyldopa) § Corticosteroids § Hypnotics, sedatives or other CNS depressants (diazepam, phenothiazines) § Anti-asthmatic agents  "

Transient infertility and irregular cycles may occur after discontinuation. Note: Norethisterone enanthate can be given up to 2 weeks (14 days) early or 2 weeks (14 days) late. § Implant Contraceptives Levonorgestrel implant [Jadelle is effective for five years (reversible by surgical removal).

Severe anaemia (Hb < 8 gms) after 36 weeks of gestation requires admission and possible transfusion, as well as oral iron therapy. (See the chapter on Blood).  Cardiac disease in Pregnancy Types of cardiac disease: n rheumatic heart disease accounts for over 95% of conditions n hypertension n puerperal cardiomyopathy n congenital heart disease n post-operative cardiac patients Antenatal Management The woman should be managed by a specialist obstetrician and physician together, and should be seen more frequently than usual. In the antenatal period avoid fluid overload, anaemia and infection. Any infection should be treated aggressively with the appropriate antibiotics. Treatment: See treatment of heart failure in the chapter on cardiovascular conditions. Anticoagulants for patients on long term anticoagulation (e.g. valve replacement) - warfarin should be avoided in the first trimester. Use heparin or low molecular weight heparin for the first 13 weeks, and change back to warfarin between weeks 13 – 37. After 37 weeks change back to heparin until after delivery. Warfarin can be commenced 24hrs after delivery. Labour in cardiac patients "

" 80 (gestational diabetes), usually in the second trimester. Ideally, all pregnant diabetics should be managed by specialists. For general information refer to the relevant section in the chapter on diabetes. § Strict blood sugar control preconceptually is advised. § Good blood sugar control with insulin, diet and exercise is essential. All known diabetics should have their glucose control assessed before conceiving if possible. § Throughout pregnancy blood sugar control should be kept strictly within the range 4-6mmol/L. Control should be measured by regular blood sugar profile (admit and take 4 hourly blood glucose levels for 24 hours). Insulin requirements will increase as pregnancy progresses, so profiles will be necessary at frequent intervals of approximately 2 weeks. § Labour should be in a tertiary level hospital. Well-controlled diabetics may be allowed to go into labour spontaneously up to term provided the foetus is clinically well. If labour is induced, give half the usual insulin dose in the morning and start an intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% at 1 litre per hour. Labour should not be prolonged. After labour, manage the patient on a sliding scale of insulin.

Most useful between 28-35 weeks gestation. § Give the mother:  Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  dexamethasone im C V 12mg for 2 doses 12 hours apart   Cervical ripeners/ labour initiators (Prostaglandins) Use prostaglandins (PG) with caution in multiparous women. Excessive uterine contractions can lead to uterine rupture, particularly if the cervix is not ripe. Cervical ripeners: Prostaglandins are powerful medicines, although classed as cervical ripeners they are better called labour initiators, only to be used on a good indication. The higher the parity, the higher the chances of uterine rupture. § The safest and simplest method of ripening the cervix: Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration misoprostol pv B V 50 mcg Once daily Max 1 dose misoprostol po B V 25mcg 4 hourly Max 3 doses  Traction method Where no medicines are available, a size 14 Foley’s catheter can be inserted through the cervix under clean conditions, and then inflated with 40ml water.

" 89 General Guidelines Accurate laboratory-proven diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STI) is not always possible. Management guidelines recommended in this section are based on the diagnosis of STI - associated syndromes. This involves the provision of the complete management package including provision of antibiotics for the STI syndrome, provision of health education, promoting risk reduction behaviour and treatment compliance, provision of condoms, providing information on partner referral and treatment and arranging for follow-up examination. (To prevent further spread it is essential that all contacts of persons with STI be traced and treated). First line therapy is recommended when the patient makes his/her first contact with the health care facility. Second line therapy is administered when first line therapy has failed, re-infection and poor treatment compliance have been excluded, and other diagnoses have been considered. Third line therapy should only be used when expert attention and adequate laboratory facilities are available, and where results of treatment can be monitored. To ensure complete cure, doses less than those recommended must not be administered. The use of inadequate doses of antibiotics encourages the growth of resistant organisms, which will then be very difficult to treat. Urethral Discharge in Men The commonest causes are Neisseria gonorrhoea and chlamydia trachomatis and the two often co-exist. Trichomonas vaginalis causes a urethral discharge in men. All males with urethral discharge and all women with cervicitis should be treated for both gonorrhoea and chlamydia in view of the fact that the two coexist and present with similar symptoms and signs.  Any sexual partners in the preceding three months should be treated presumptively for the same infections and any other conditions found on examination. § First Line:  Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration   kanamycin im C  V  2g[1g into each buttock] one dose only  or ceftriaxone C V 250mg IM one dose only  And doxycycline po C V 100mg twice a day 7 days or azithromycin po C V 1g one dose only   § If the patient still has a urethral discharge, or evidence of urethritis 7 days after start of treatment, suspect re-infection, poor treatment compliance or antimicrobial resistance in "

Vaginal Discharge in Women All women with a vaginal discharge must have a vaginal examination. Some vaginal discharges are normal. However, any woman concerned about a vaginal discharge should be examined and the patient managed appropriately. All women presenting with abnormal vaginal discharge should receive treatment for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. Additional treatment for yeast infection is indicated only when clinically apparent (curd-like discharge, redness of the vulva and vulva itching). Yeast infection is a common cause of vaginitis in pregnancy.  Treatment for cervical infection both gonococcal and chlamydial infection should be given in situations where infection seems likely or the risk of developing complications is high. Treatment for cervical infection should be added to the treatment for vaginal infections if suspected (for example a patient’s partner has urethral discharge), or if the signs of cervical infection (mucopurulent cervical discharge or easy bleeding) are seen on speculum examination.

" 94 Genital Ulcers in Men & Women (with or without buboes) The commonest cause of genital ulcers in both men and women is genital herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. Syphilis and chancroid also cause genital ulcers but their prevalence has dropped significantly. Clinical differentiation between the causes of genital ulcers is inaccurate except if the patient gives a clear history of recurrent attacks of vesicular lesions that may crust and heal spontaneously or if the clinical appearance of the lesions are those of superficial ulcers, when the diagnosis of genital herpes may be suspected. It should be noted that syphilis may remain undetected in the body for long periods of time and clinical manifestations may only occur when long-term complications develop. Syphilis, although rare nowadays, should be ruled out in all patients presenting with genital ulcers. Immunosuppressed persons with HIV infection frequently develop attacks of genital herpes that produce lesions, which persist and require treatment with acyclovir. Hence it is important to bear in mind all these three diagnoses whenever managing persons with genital ulcers syndromically. First Line treatment of genital ulcers: Advice on local hygiene such as washing twice a day with salt water (1 teaspoon salt to 1 litre water) and give the following:  Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  benzathine penicillin im  C V 2.4Megaunits(1.44gm) Once only night  and ciprofloxacin  C V 500mg Twice a day 3 days And  acyclovir C V 400mg Three times a day 5 days or acyclovir C V 200mg Five times a day 5 days In case of penicillin allergy, use doxycycline 100mg twice a day for 20 days CAUTION IN PREGNANCY: see chapter on Obsteric and Gynaecological Conditions. Doxycycline should not be used during pregnancy or in lactating mothers. In pregnant women genital ulcers are best treated with erythromycin 500mg four times a day for 14 days or 30 days depending on stage of syphilis (<2yrs or > 2yrs) Recurrent or vesicular genital lesions Recurrent herpes in HIV negative people will almost always heal spontaneously without treatment. Lesions seen early in the episode (when still vesicular) or that are failing to heal should be treated as herpes simplex virus infection as follows:   Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  acyclovir po B V 400mg Three times a day 7 days "

Treat by cryotherapy, electro-cautery, or by surgical excision. Molluscum Contagiosum The lesions of molluscum contagiosum may resolve spontaneously.  In most instances, they do not have to be treated unless cosmetically unacceptable. If not acceptable, each lesion should be pricked with a sharpened “orange-stick” or needle and the contents of the lesion expressed. This alone may be sufficient, or each lesion can then be touched carefully with liquefied phenol.  Lesions of molluscum contagiosum may become extensive and large in immunosuppressed persons with HIV infection.

" 102 General guidelines These guidelines aim to encourage a consistent clinical management approach and draw a balance between possible interventions and available resources. Further information is available in the Guidelines for Antiretroviral Therapy in Zimbabwe. Always refer to the latest edition of these guidelines. Clinical presentation Clinical presentation in HIV infection varies greatly, from asymptomatic infection in a normal, fit individual to life threatening conditions. The majority of infected persons remain healthy for a varying period, often many years, but may transmit the virus to others during unprotected sex. General Notes  All patients should be offered HIV counselling and testing services (PITC). A documented proof of a positive HIV test result should be availed before a patient is enrolled into the Chronic HIV Care program. . For notes on the management of HIV infection and related conditions in children, see also “Paediatric Infections”. The goal is to provide the earliest possible diagnosis of HIV infection, diagnose opportunistic infections (OIs) promptly and implement therapeutic measures that will extend and improve the quality of life.  Please refer to the Guidelines for Antiretroviral Therapy in Zimbabwe for more detail about how to deal with OIs and how to use the ARVs. Most early problems can be adequately and effectively treated so that the HIV infected persons continue to lead a normal and productive life. A continuum of care should be provided from the nearest possible facility to the home or workplace.  If a patient presents at the primary care level (“C level”) or district hospital (“B level”), follow EDLIZ as far as possible, then refer to the next level. Keep referrals to a minimum and only where essential for investigations requiring specialised facilities and specialist advice. Check where your nearest OI/ART Clinic is. The following are fundamental to the management of HIV related illness, but cannot be covered fully here (Refer to the national guidelines): § counselling: pre-testing, post-test, crisis/support; § health education for prevention of further transmission of HIV, positive living; § Maintenance of good nutrition, vitamin and mineral supplements. § Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of OIs "
   
" 103 § Use of antiretroviral medicines Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis: Cotrimoxazole has been shown to prolong life and reduce hospital admissions in those with symptomatic HIV or AIDS.  Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be given to the following: • All patients with WHO clinical stages 2, 3, and 4 disease • All patients with CD4 counts equal or less than 350 cells/mm3 • Pregnant women with CD4 counts equal or less than 350 cells/mm3 • All children born to HIV-positive mothers from six weeks of age until they are tested and confirmed to be HIV negative • Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be started as soon as any of the above conditions are suspected; this should be done at every entry point and not just be left to the OI clinics.  Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  cotrimoxazole po C V 960mg Once a day for life or until CD4>350 for 6 months for patients on ART Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in children  Give once daily orally according to the following table.

EDLIZ 2015   
" 104 • Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be commenced at least one to two weeks before the commencement of ART. This allows time to identify those who might be allergic to cotrimoxazole.  • This prophylaxis should be continued indefinitely.  • For patients who are allergic to cotrimoxazole, consider using Dapsone or desensitization. Desensitization can be offered rapidly or over a longer period of time. Do not desensitize anyone who has had an anaphylactic reaction to cotrimoxazole or a severe skin rash such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome Isoniazid Preventative Therapy (IPT): Isoniazid preventative therapy is the provision of the medicine isoniazid to people at high risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). People living with HIV are 20 to 37 times more likely to develop active TB from latent TB than those without HIV, making HIV infection the strongest risk factor for TB disease. TB is responsible for more than a quarter of deaths of people living with HIV. IPT has been shown to reduce the incidence of TB in HIV-infected people with LTBI by 33-62%. Among PLHIV, IPT is likely to provide protection against the risk of developing TB by decreasing the risks of:  • Progression of recent infection  • Reactivation of latent M. Tuberculosis In addition, IPT programs decrease the rate of TB in the community and improve TB control. Note: Isoniazid, like any other medicines, can cause side effects. Look out for gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatitis, skins reactions and peripheral neuropathy. Contraindications to IPT: § Active TB (confirmed or suspected) § Known or suspected hypersensitivity to INH § Self-reported chronic liver disease or symptoms suggesting active hepatitis( jaundice, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pai, dark urine, pale stools) § Excessive alcohol use § History of convulsions and psychosis § Moderately severe peripheral neuropathy "

No treatment is required, but exclude other causes of PGL, particularly TB, Kaposi’s Sarcoma, lymphomas or syphilis.   Oral and Oesophageal Candidiasis (Thrush)  – Refer to Chapter on Common Oral Conditions Candida infections are commonly encountered in patients with HIV infection. Oral thrush may precede AIDS but is a sign of waning immunity that heralds the development of AIDS. Oesophageal thrush is an indicator of more severe cellular immunodeficiency.

" 109 HIV Related Respiratory Conditions A multitude of different manifestations of respiratory complications may occur in patients with HIV infection. These include bacterial pneumonias, pulmonary tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and pulmonary Kaposi’s sarcoma. All HIV infected patients should be screened for TB at every visit using the standard TB screening tools. Management depends on the severity of the condition, location and mobility of the patient. Outpatient management is preferred wherever possible in adults. Only severe cases requiring investigations and inpatient admission should be referred. Treat initially as for other respiratory conditions.

Headache and Problems of the Nervous System The symptom of headache is commonly encountered in patients with HIV infection. Careful evaluation and follow up is required to exclude meningitis and other CNS infections. Refer for lumbar puncture and other investigations if duration is more than 7 days or if the headache is associated with fever, vomiting, neck stiffness, seizures, confusion and not responding to pain killers. Also refer to Section on Neurological Conditions "
   
" 111 Other commonly encountered neurological conditions in HIV infection include AIDS dementia complex, peripheral neuropathy, Guillan-Barré syndrome, facial nerve palsy and stroke. Cryptococcal Meningitis Cryptococcal meningitis is caused by Cryptococcus Neoformans and is less acute in onset than bacterial meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by India Ink Stain and cryptococcal antigen tests (CRAIG). May occur as part of the Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS). Treatment of cryptococcal disease must be with amphotericin B based regimens. Ideally amphotericin B must be combined with flucytosine. However in our setting, combination therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole is recommended. In the absence of amphotericin B, high dose of fluconazole can be used as alternative therapy. Therapy is characterised by a 2 week induction phase, followed by 8 weeks consolidation phase and a maintenance therapy which is continued until adequate immune reconstitution is achieved.

Prevention of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients after completion of primary  Mortality and morbidity from cryptococcal meningitis is high with a significant proportion attributable to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Management of raised ICP is critical to ensure good clinical outcomes. If the ICP is > 25cm of water, remove 10-30ml of CSF and continue with daily lumbar punctures until CSF pressures have normalised (< 25cm of water). A repeat lumbar puncture at 2 weeks after initiation of appropriate induction of antifungal therapy is not necessary except in the setting of persistently elevated ICP and evidence of poor clinical response.   Management of Amphotericin B associated toxicities  Amphotericin B, particularly amphotericin deoxycholate is associated with renal tubular toxicities and can lead to electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. It can also result in anaemia and administration related febrile reactions.  • Amphotericin B is often provided as a powder and should be mixed with 5% dextrose water. It should NEVER be mixed with normal saline or half normal saline as this will result in precipitation of the amphotericin B. To minimize renal toxicities, amphoterin B must be administered slowly over 4 hours. Initial therapeutic doses should be given as Amphotericin B 0.7-1mg/kg/day. • Prehydration with 500ml -1000ml (1L) of normal saline with 20mEq of potassium chloride is recommended based on the "
   
" 113 volume status of the patient. Patients must receive oral potassium supplementation such as 1200mg twice a day. The potassium supplementation minimizes the extent of hypokalemia that can develop. Where available supplementation with magnesium trisilicate 500mg orally twice daily is also recommended.  • Renal function must be monitored at baseline. U&Es should be measured twice weekly.  If the creatinine doubles, a dose of amphotericin B can be omitted and prehydration increased to 1L of normal saline every 8 hours and creatinine rechecked. If creatinine normalises, prehydrate with 1L normal saline with 20mEq KCl and restart at amphotericin B (0.7mg/kg/day) given over 4 hours. Monitor renal function weekly.   If repeat creatinine remains elevated or continues to increase, amphotericin B should be discontinued and high dose fluconazole 1200mg orally once daily initiated.   AIDS dementia complex  Characterized by progressive impairment in cognitive function that is accompanied by behavioural changes and motor abnormalities. Exclude other causes of dementia. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the best treatment to offer. Provide supportive care for the patient and their family. If psychotic or depressive features are prominent, refer for/add specific therapy to cover these conditions. (See the chapter on Psychiatric Conditions). HIV Related Skin Conditions Skin manifestations of HIV infection may be the result of opportunistic infections or HIV itself. The usual treatment regimens are valid, but often a more aggressive application is required: duration of treatment may need to be longer and relapse is common when treatment is stopped. Persons with HIV/AIDS should be informed of the likelihood of increased photosensitivity, as many develop hyperpigmentation of the face and the “V” of the neck. Excessive exposure to the sun should be avoided.

" 116 Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) Patients with KS are in WHO clinical stage 4 and should be initiated on ART as soon as possible irregardless of the CD4 count. Antiretroviral medicines are indicated, but chemotherapy may also be required. If possible, refer patients for specialist opinion prior to starting ART (this might avoid IRIS which may occur with extensive KS) and get a tissue diagnosis before referral. KS patients (good general health, early KS, ≤5 lesions) may respond to ART alone but most patients will need chemotherapy. Assess for signs and symptoms of inner organ involvement.  Early or trivial KS may respond to ART alone but many patients present late and with a heavy tumour burden. Thus these patients need chemotherapy to reduce the tumour burden and then ART. Immune reconstitution with ART occurs and may worsen the KS dramatically. Note that patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), cervix cancer, squamous cell conjunctival carcinoma are likely to be HIV positive and will need ART and treatment for the cancer (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy).

"118  General Notes  Appropriate and effective provision of ARVs needs to be provided by those who have received standardised training in the management of opportunistic infections as well as in the use of antiretroviral medicines. For more details on the use of ARVs refer to the current Antiretroviral Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV in Zimbabwe.  Attempts should be made to train healthcare workers in HIV management   Comprehensive HIV/AIDS care requires that there be provision of counselling; either VCT or PITC, laboratory capacity for baseline assessment and monitoring as well as to diagnose commonly encountered opportunistic infections such as TB and cryptococcal meningitis. Pharmacy personnel should also be trained in OI/ART management as they will be required to ensure rational prescribing and proper dispensing of the antiretroviral medicines. In addition, they will also be required to ensure that their hospital/clinic has adequate ARV medicine supplies.   Goals of ART  The aims of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are: • Maximal and durable suppression of replication of HIV,  • Restoration and/or preservation of immune function,  • Reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality,  • Improvement of quality of life.  • Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (vertical transmission), and • Reduction of transmission of HIV from infected to uninfected individuals through use of ARVs by the infected individual now commonly known as ‘Treatment as prevention’.  Criteria for initiating ART in adolescents and adults Prior to starting ART, patients should be assessed for readiness to take ARVs; the ARV regimen; dosage and scheduling; the likely potential adverse effects; and the required monitoring. Both medical and psychosocial issues need to be addressed before initiating ART. Patients should be adequately counseled about adopting appropriate life style measures such as safer sexual practices (including appropriate use of condoms), and any other psychosocial problems that may interfere with adherence (e.g., alcohol, psychiatric disorders) should be addressed. At each clinic visit always screen for tuberculosis using a TB symptom checklist, advise patients about adequate nutrition and the importance of medicine adherence and regular follow up care. People taking ARVs should also be regularly asked on whether they are taking "
   
" 119 other medicines including herbal remedies that may interfere with the efficacy of ARVs.   Early treatment initiation is associated with clinical and HIV prevention benefits, improving survival and reducing the incidence of HIV infection at the community level. Increasing evidence also indicate that untreated HIV may be associated with the development of severe non-AIDS defining conditions including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease and neurocognitive disorders. Recent results from the HPTN 052 Study strongly support the use of ART to prevent HIV transmission among sero-discordant couples.  Medical Criteria for initiating ART in adolescents/ adults  ART should be provided to all people with confirmed HIV diagnosis and with a CD4 count of ≤ 500cels /mm3.  As a priority, initiate ART in all individuals with severe/advanced HIV disease (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4) or CD4 count less or equal to 350 cells/ mm3. It is also recommended to initiate ART in the following categories of patients regardless of CD4 cell count: • Active TB disease • Pregnant and breast-feeding women with HIV • Individuals with HIV in sero-discordant relationships • HBV co-infection with severe chronic liver disease Patients with CD4 <100 Patients with low CD4 below 100 should be fast-tracked for treatment initiation. They should be screened for symptomatic TB and cryptococcal disease. They should receive Cotrimoxazole and INH prophylaxis like all other patients and should be closely monitored for 3 months as this is their highest risk period for bacterial infections and TB or cryptococcal IRIS. Health workers should educate them and their families to report immediately to a health facility if they are unwell whilst their CD4 is< 100.   "
EDLIZ 2015   
120  
" The revised medical criteria of initiating ARVs at CD4 count ≤ 500 cells/ mm3 means that many more PLHIV will be eligible for ART and that will include many healthier people  Psychosocial criteria for initiating ART   Consider the following psychosocial criteria when initiating ART:  • Has the patient completed the prescribed counselling session(s)? • Is a treatment partner available and/or has disclosure been made to that treatment partner (strongly encouraged)?  • Is there an easy method of following up on the patient? • Is the patient ready to take medications indefinitely? Situations where it may be necessary to defer ART initiation A patient may be deferred (delayed) from starting therapy if the patient  • has cryptococcal meningitis,  • needs further psychosocial counselling (e.g., for alcohol problems), • has TB (defer starting ART for at least 2 weeks) • needs further information on HIV and AIDS, • Very ill patient and unable to swallow oral medication (palliative care is then offered to such a patient).  SUCH PATIENTS SHOULD BE OFFERED CONTINUED MONITORING AND CLOSE FOLLOW-UP AS WELL AS Adults and Adolescents with a documented positive HIV test and meeting any one of the following criteria: Criteria Treatment Decision Severe or advanced symptomatic HIV infection (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4) Treat all regardless of CD4 cell count Asymptomatic/mild HIV disease Treat CD4 ≤ 500 cells/mm3 (CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm3 as a priority) HIV sero-discordant couples Treat infected partner  regardless of CD4 cell count TB co-infection Treat all HIV Positive TB patients regardless of CD4 cell count Hepatitis B co-infection Treat regardless of CD4 count in presence of chronic severe liver disease HIV positive Pregnant  and lactating women Treat all regardless of CD4 cell count  "
   
" 121 COUNSELLING SO THAT ART CAN BE COMMENCED AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. Adherence to ART   WHO defines treatment adherence as ‘the extent to which a person’s behaviour- taking medications, following a diet and/or executes lifestyle changes’ corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider.  Efforts to support adherence should start before ART initiation and should include basic information about HIV, the ARV medicines, expected adverse events, preparations for long-term ART. Effective adherence support interventions include client-centred behavioural counselling and support, support from peer educators trained as “expert patients,” community treatment supporters and mobile text messaging. Other interventions involve encouraging people to disclose their HIV status and providing them with adherence tools such as pill boxes, diaries, and patient reminder aids. During follow-up, patients should be assessed for adherence to whatever treatment plan has been agreed upon (Integrated HIV training curriculum, MoHCC). Recommended treatment regimens for adolescents and adults  The choice of medicine regimen is based on the “essential medicine” concept and the rational use of medicine. To maximise adherence, use of FDC medicines is strongly encouraged. A large number of medicines and medicine combinations have been used in the treatment of persons with HIV infection. The choice of ARVs has been based on evidence of efficacy and safety, on availability and cost of medications, as well as on the side effects profile and the potential for development of resistance. The national ART programme will use the following FDCs in the first line regimens: Dual combinations: • tenofovir (TDF) 300mg + lamivudine (3TC) 300mg zidovudine (AZT) 300mg + lamivudine (3TC) 150mg  • The above dual FDC should be used in combination with single formulation of:  • Efavirenz (EFV) 600mg once daily • Nevirapine (NVP) 200mg twice a day (after the 2 weeks of once a day nevirapine) Triple combinations: • Tenofovir 300mg+ Lamivudine 300mg+Efavirenz(EFV) 600mg • Zidovudine 300mg + Lamivudine 150mg + Nevirapine(NVP) 200mg  "
EDLIZ 2015   
"122  Please note that the national ART programme has phased out Stavudine-based regimens.  Tenofovir (TDF) plus Lamivudine (3TC) plus Efavirenz (EFV) is the preferred first-line regimen, which obviously would necessitate a change in the currently used second-line regimens.  Preferred First-line regimen "
"Caution: Tenofovir (TDF) TDF may be associated with acute kidney Injury or chronic kidney disease as well as reduced bone mineral density in pregnant women. Clinical considerations when using TDF • Patients should be initiated on TDF even in the absence of laboratory monitoring capacity. However, efforts should be made to strengthen laboratory monitoring of patients • Routine blood pressure monitoring. • Urine dipsticks may be used to detect glycosuria or severe TDF nephrotoxicity in individuals without diabetes using TDF-containing regimens. • If the creatinine test is routinely available, use the estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline before initiating TDF regimens. • Do not initiate TDF when the estimated glomerular filtration rate is <50 ml/min, or in long term diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension and renal failure.

Second-line treatment recommendation for adults and adolescents  Ideally, patients who fail to respond to first-line treatment should be treated with a different regimen that contains medicines that were not included in the first regimen. The second-line regimen will still consist of two NRTIs but with a PI. The second-line regimen should be initiated only after assessing treatment adherence and failure and in consultation with a specialist in HIV and AIDS treatment or the clinical mentorship team at the OI/ART clinic, as the recommendation will be based on what the patient is already taking or has taken in the past. Clinical mentors should be consulted where there is doubt about what to do. More adherence counselling will be required in preparation for the planned new therapy.

Use of ARVs in patients with TB  (refer to the latest national TB guidelines or TB/HIV guidelines) TB is the most common OI encountered among people with HIV infection in Zimbabwe. Since the advent of the pandemic of HIV infection, TB has remained a serious public-health problem. Studies have shown that up to 50% of people with HIV infection develop TB and that up to 85% of patients with TB have HIV infection. In addition, TB accounts for a third of HIV-related deaths. There is a need to integrate the HIV and TB services, as TB and HIV coinfection is common. All patients living with HIV should be screened for TB at every visit using the standard TB screening tools. Rifampicin interacts adversely with some antiretroviral agents such as PIs and Nevirapine.  The preferred regimen for HIV positive TB patients is Tenofovir plus Lamivudine and Efavirenz. Patients with TB who are not yet on ART In patients who have HIV-related TB but are not yet on ART, treatment of TB takes priority. ART should be started at least two weeks after the start of TB therapy i.e. during the intensive phase when the patient has stabilised on TB treatment regardless of their CD4 count status. TB/HIV co-infected patients with severe immunosuppression such as CD4 count less than 50 cells/mm3, should receive ART early i.e. within the first 2 weeks of initiating TB treatment.  Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be provided with the commencement of the TB therapy if the patient is not on it already. Patients who develop TB when already on ART Treat TB as per national TB guidelines.  Use of ARVs in Patients with Cryptococcal Meningitis "
   
" 127 Prevention of Cryptococcal Disease Patients initiating ART with undiagnosed cryptococcal disease are at higher risk of early mortality than patients who are pre-emptively diagnosed and treated for cryptococcal disease. All patients initiating ART should be clinically screened for evidence of symptomatic cryptococcal disease – headache, neck stiffness, fever, focal neurologic signs, confusion, and altered mental status. All those who screen positive should be referred for further diagnostic work up for meningitis. Screening of asymptomatic ART naïve individuals with CD4 count <100cells/mm3 is recommended and should be done with a Cryptococcal neoformans antigen test (CrAg) using latex agglutination tests (LA) or lateral flow assays (LFA) on serum, plasma or CSF. A lumbar puncture should be offered to individuals who screen positive for cryptococcal antigen, as a positive cryptococcal antigen may precede the onset of clinical cryptococcal meningitis by many weeks. Individuals who are screened for cryptococcal disease should be managed as indicated in Table 8.2.  Table 8.2: Treatment decisions for asymptomatic cryptococcal disease Serum CrAg negative No LP necessary. No fluconazole required. Initiate ART. Serum CrAg positive If available recommend LP:  If CSF CrAg positive, manage for cryptococcal meningitis   If CSF CrAg negative treat with Fluconazole 800mg orally once daily for 2 weeks, then Fluconazole 400mg orally daily for 8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with Fluconazole 200mg orally daily until CD4>200 cells/mm3 for 6 months   Timing of ART for individuals with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia is unknown. We recommend initiation of ART 2-4 weeks after initiation of antifungal therapy in individuals who screen positive for serum CrAg without any evidence of disseminated cryptococcal meningitis.  Timing of ART in cryptococcal meningitis The timing of the initiation of ART in patients with cryptococcal meningitis is still uncertain. Early initiation of ART is recommended for all OIs except for intracranial OIs such as TB meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis. In cryptococcal meningitis ART can be initiated 2- 4 weeks after initiation of antifungal therapy with amphotericin B based regimens. In patients who are predominately treated with "
EDLIZ 2015   
"128  fluconazole monotherapy ART should be initiated at least 4 weeks after initiation of antifungal therapy.  ART should not be commenced at the same time that amphotericin B and/or fluconazole therapy is commenced for cryptococcal meningitis.   Use of ARVs in Children  More than 90% of HIV-infected children acquire their infection through mother to child transmission of HIV (vertical transmission). Thus, elimination of new HIV infections among children through effective PMTCT interventions should be prioritized. HIV disease progression occurs very rapidly in the first few months of life in infants acquiring HIV in utero, often leading to death. The importance of early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV infection and early initiation of ART can therefore not be overemphasised.   Early infant diagnosis  All infants should have their HIV-exposure status established at their first contact with the health system, ideally before six weeks of age. Check for HIV exposure status on the child health card, or inquire from the mother or caregiver. Where the mother is available and was not tested during pregnancy, perform a rapid HIV test on the mother and if she is positive, then her infant is HIV exposed and needs to have a DBS collected for HIV DNA PCR.  At 9 months of age, most infants (93%) no longer possess maternally transferred antibodies. Prior to the age of 18 months, a DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for HIV is more reliable. A DNA PCR test should be offered to all exposed infants from six weeks of age. If the DNA PCR test is negative before the age of 18 months, the infant does not have HIV infection but is at risk of infection if breastfeeding is continued.   In an infant, outside the window period (three months after last exposure - labour/delivery, or breastfeeding) and rapid HIV test is negative, then the infant has not been infected with HIV and can be considered definitively negative.  If an infant is still within the window period, and rapid HIV test is negative then the infant is still considered to be HIV exposed and may be infected and should be managed as an HIV-exposed infant.   Where virological testing is not available for children less than 18 months, a presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV disease should be made if the infant is confirmed HIV antibody positive and: "
   
" 129 1. Diagnosis of any AIDS-defining condition(s) can be made, or 2. The infant is symptomatic with two or more of the following:  1. Oral thrush 2. Severe pneumonia 3. Severe sepsis  Infants under 18 months of age with clinically diagnosed presumptive severe HIV should be started on ART. Confirmation of HIV diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible.  Recommendations for antibody testing in infants Antibody tests (rapid and laboratory-based ELISA) are the preferred method of diagnosis for HIV infection for children over 18 months of age.  In a child under 18 months who has never been breastfed and HIV antibody tests are negative,  this child is uninfected and virological testing is indicated only if clinical signs or subsequent events suggest HIV infection.   In a child under 18 months who has not breastfed for more than six weeks, HIV antibody tests that are negative mean the child is uninfected. HIV antibody tests that are positive at any age under 18 months identify those infants who need virological tests (i.e., the child is HIV exposed but needs definitive test with HIV DNA PCR to confirm HIV infection).  Care of an HIV-exposed infant  Initial care Care for HIV-exposed infants should include the following: • Make sure HIV-exposed infants are entered into the “HIV exposed follow-up register” • All HIV-exposed infants should have HIV DNA PCR testing performed from six weeks of age or at the earliest possible time thereafter if 6 weeks testing is missed. • Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be given from six weeks of age until the HIV status of the infant is known. If the HIV infection is confirmed, continue cotrimoxazole and commence on ART. • Monthly follow up visits are recommended, but more frequent visits may be needed if problems are detected. "
EDLIZ 2015   
"130  During these visits the following services should be provided: • Growth monitoring and promotion • Developmental  assessment   Counselling on infant and young child feeding: • Counselling and support for the HIV infected mother to adhere to ART is crucial. • Weaning should not be abrupt, but rather should be gradual over a one month period.   • HIV-infected infants diagnosed by virological testing or infants with symptoms suggestive of HIV should continue breastfeeding for as long as possible. • Immunisations should be given according to the national guidelines. The BCG vaccination should still be given at birth, but BCG should not be given to children with symptomatic HIV infection. • Always look for and treat opportunistic infections. Management of an HIV-infected child using ARVs  Infants and young children have an exceptionally high risk of poor outcomes from HIV infection.  The goal of ART for children is to increase survival and decrease HIV-related morbidity and mortality.   Criteria to initiate ART in children  1. All children below 5 years of age MUST be commenced on ART irrespective of their CD4 count.  2. All children 5 years and above with paediatric WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease MUST be commenced on ART irrespective of CD4 percentage. 3.  Children≥5 years with WHO clinical stage 1 or 2 and a CD4 count less than 500 should be commenced on ART  (see Appendix II for clinical staging) Table 8.3: Recommendations on when to start ART in children (Adopted from WHO 2013 HIV guidelines)  "

Disclosure: The process of disclosure to the child should be initiated as early as possible, usually from as early as 5 – 7 years of age.

 135  USE OF ARVS FOR PREVENTION OF MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION OF HIV (PMTCT) GENERAL NOTES 136 INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD FEEDING RECOMMENDATIONS 138  
EDLIZ 2015   
"136  General Notes  Mother-to-child transmission is responsible for more than 90% of HIV infection in children and at least two thirds of such infections occur during pregnancy and delivery whilst the remainder occur during breastfeeding. It is therefore critical to identify HIV-positive pregnant and lactating women and manage them appropriately. When to start ART in HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women   • All HIV infected pregnant and breastfeeding women should initiate lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) irrespective of their CD4 count or WHO clinical stage (Option B+).   • Women who are not yet ready for lifelong ART should be initiated on triple ARVs (ART), which should be continued at least for the duration of breastfeeding to prevent further risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast milk.  • HIV infected lactating women meeting treatment eligibility criteria (CD4 500 or less) should continue lifelong ART according to criteria for adult non-pregnant populations as it would be inappropriate for them to discontinue ART after the breastfeeding period.  N.B. Pregnant and breastfeeding women who were initiated on Zidovudine prophylaxis should be discontinued and commenced on lifelong ART (Option B+).  Being on lifelong ART will necessitate ongoing counselling of HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women to support retention and adherence and to minimize loss to follow-up.  • Emphasise modes of HIV transmission and prevention, PMTCT, and access to care and treatment. • Encourage partner HIV testing and counselling  • Encourage the importance of skilled birth attendance, clean and safe delivery, and newborn care.  • Counsel on infant and young child feeding and maternal nutrition.  • Counsel on sexual and reproductive health including family planning and the need for dual contraception (reliable hormonal contraceptive plus barrier method like male or female condoms)  • Make an appointment for family planning at six weeks postpartum. "
   
" 137 • Stress the need for condom use for prevention of STIs and HIV during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.  • Retest previously negative women in 3rd trimester of pregnancy and/ or at delivery, 6 weeks post natally and 6 monthly thereafter. • Stress the importance of follow-up for the HIV exposed  infant  o Commence cotrimoxazole prophylaxis from 6 weeks of age  o Collect Dried Blood Spot (DBS) for HIV DNA PCR test at 6 weeks of age i.e.Early Infant Diagnosis (EID). o Infants should be re-tested at the end of the breast-feeding period  Table 9.1: Timing of Initiation of ART for Mother and ARV Prophylaxis for Infant (PMTCT)  Pregnancy Labour Post delivery (breastfeeding and non breastfeeding) Maternal Infant (Birth to six weeks) Preferred first line  Tenofovir + Lamivudine +Efavirenz   BW<2500: NVP 10mg daily BW ≥2500: NVP 15mg daily Alternative First line  Zidovudine +Lamivudine + Efavirenz  BW<2500: NVP 10mg daily BW≥2500: NVP 15mg daily  When using ARVs in pregnant women, certain precautions should be kept in mind:  Efavirenz (EFV) Previously there was a recommendation not to use Efavirenz during the first trimester and in women at risk of becoming pregnant. However, WHO issued evidence based update on Efavirenz safety in pregnancy in 2011 which recommends it to be safe for use even in the first trimester.  "
EDLIZ 2015   
"138  Infant and young child feeding recommendations   All mothers whether known to be infected with HIV or not should exclusively breastfeed their infants (no mixed feeding) for the first 6 months of life, introducing safe, adequate and nutritious complementary foods thereafter, with continued breastfeeding up to 24 months and beyond.  ARV prophylaxis in an HIV-exposed infant HIV-exposed infants whose mothers are on lifelong ART should be commenced on Nevirapine prophylaxis for six weeks.    Table 9.2: Infant Nevirapine prophylaxis  Age Nevirapine dosage  Birth to six weeks BW  <2500*:  10mg once daily BW ≥ 2500:  15mg once daily  • Always remember to change the dose when baby gains weight.  • *For very low birth weight babies below 2000g dose of NVP is 2 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks • If any contraindications to NVP use 3TC 4mg per kg 12hourly for 6 weeks • For non-breastfeeding infants NVP as above or AZT 4mg/kg 12 hourly for 6 weeks "

"140  General Notes Tuberculosis is a chronic, infectious, debilitating disease, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is a public health problem and all cases must be notified to the Provincial/City Medical Director in terms of the Public Health Act. Due to the association between TB and HIV infection, the prevalence of TB is increasing, and patients are often more seriously ill than before. Control of Tuberculosis - TB Policy For more information on National Policy and the organisation of the TB services refer to the Ministry of Health & Child Care’s ZIMBABWE TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROGRAMME MANUAL.  The essential points of the TB policy are: • Sputum microscopy for diagnosis and follow up provided free of charge in the public health sector • Short-course chemotherapy provided free of charge in the public health sector • Treatment of Drug Resistant TB(DRTB) provided for free of charge in the public sector • TB services available at all levels of the health delivery system, being integrated into the primary health care system to ensure efficient case finding, particularly for sputum smear positive patients n Collaborative TB/HIV activities at all levels  An important emphasis of the TB programme is the direct observation of treatment (DOTS), which means that a treatment supervisor watches the patient actually swallowing the tablets. A supervisor can either be a healthcare worker or a trained member of the community.  TB control is administered in a standardised way from the Central level to Health Centre level.  Within this system notification, registration, record keeping and contact tracing activities in addition to treatment are carried out. It is essential that all patients requiring TB treatment be referred for management in the National TB Programme. TB fixed dose combinations are to be available at all levels from C through to A. Single formulations’ level of availability is B level medicines. TB medicines are accorded V level of priority. Prevention  Primary prevention  "
   
" 141 § BCG vaccination is given at birth or at first contact with the child after birth (except in babies with clinical signs of HIV infection and/or in infants born to a mother with sputum positive TB). § BCG vaccine should be given to all babies, even those born to mothers known to be HIV positive. § BCG is given intradermally on the right upper arm, above the insertion of the deltoid muscle.  § No booster dose should be given. The batch number of the vaccine and the date must be recorded on the child’s health card.  Dosage is as recommended by EPI Programme (see the chapter on Immunisation).  Problems associated with BCG vaccination remain uncommon and are mainly due to faulty technique. Abscesses or ulcers should be treated with local hygienic care. Abscesses should be aspirated not incised.  Secondary infections can be treated with antibiotics. Non-healing ulcers, (ulcers of duration > 8 weeks) or regional lymphadenopathy can be treated with:  Medicine Codes Dose Frequency Duration  isoniazid po B V 10mg/kg once a day 2 months  Secondary prevention  An infant born to a mother with sputum positive TB should not be given BCG at birth § Give the child isoniazid 10mg/kg day prophylaxis for two months § After two months perform a mantoux test. §  If the Mantoux test is positive give full TB treatment. §  If the Mantoux test is negative continue with isoniazid prophylaxis for four more months. § Follow with BCG vaccination if not HIV infected If parents are found to be sputum positive and the child has no signs of active TB, check the child’s BCG status and vaccinate if not already done.  In addition give isoniazid prophylaxis for 6 months to children less than three years of age:   Medicine Codes Paed Dose Frequency Duration  isoniazid po B V 10mg/kg once a day 6 months Note: For prophylaxis and treatment in neonates give isoniazid 5mg/kg/day "

IPT for HIV positive patients in whom active TB has been excluded, refer to IPT under HIV related diseases and National TB Guidelines Case Management Diagnosis  Clinical Diagnosis of TB The presence of pulmonary tuberculosis should be suspected in individuals presenting with one or more of the following complaints: • Cough for 2 weeks or longer  • Production of sputum, which may be bloodstained • Loss of appetite • Night sweats  • Fever • Loss of weight • Shortness of breath Sputum  The diagnosis of TB is made by demonstrating alcohol acid-fast bacilli (AAFB) in the sputum by direct smear microscopy (DSM). DSM is repeated at the end of the intensive and continuation phases to confirm sputum conversion and cure. Due to the concerns of medicine resistance the following patients MUST submit sputum specimens for Gene Xpert test, culture and medicine sensitivity testing to the TB Reference Laboratory n All relapses n Patients on category 1 treatment who are sputum positive at 3/5 months n Patients on category 2 treatment who are sputum positive at 3/4 months (at end of prolonged intensive phase).  n Patients on category 2 treatment who are sputum positive at the end of treatment  n Patients who are sputum-smear positive and have been in contact with MDR-TB case. n Gene-Xpert screening for all HIV positive patients n Residence in DRTB high burden zones n Return after treatment  default   Chest X-Rays  "
   
" 143 Indications for chest x-rays • A child suspected of TB  • HIV positive patient who is sputum negative • Non-response to broad-spectrum antibiotics for correct duration in sputum negative and HIV negative patient • Non-response to broad spectrum antibiotics in a sputum negative patient.  • When suspecting complications, e.g., pneumothorax, or pleural effusion  • When frequent and severe haemoptysis occurs • When other lung diseases are suspected by the medical officer • Pericardial effusion  Chest x-rays should NOT be routinely used for diagnosing pulmonary TB. In sputum positive patients a chest x-ray is not necessary.  Note: In the presence of clinical improvement, it is not necessary to monitor the response of pulmonary TB to treatment by chest x-rays  Tuberculin Testing Use Mantoux test only:  Medicine Codes Dose Frequency Duration  tuberculin, purified (PPD) 1:1000 intradermal B E 0.1ml (=5TU) - - Examine induration at 48-72 hours. § A positive Mantoux (person with normal immunity: induration > 10 mm, person with defective immunity: induration > 6 mm) may indicate active infection (especially if strongly positive), previous infection or previous BCG.  § Absence of a response does not exclude TB because individuals with HIV may not have sufficient immunity for a positive skin test despite active TB.  § If a child under 3 years of age has not had BCG, the Mantoux test may be useful. § All TB suspects should be offered HIV counselling and testing (Provider initiated testing and counselling i.e. PITC) at the same facility where the sputum is examined.  Medicine Regimens for Tuberculosis Two main treatment categories, Category 1 and Category II are now used in Zimbabwe for medicine sensitive TB. The regimens consist of a combination of five first line medicines. These medicines are available as oral Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) and an injectable, streptomycin.     The intention of these combination tablets is to improve compliance by reducing the number of tablets a patient has to take, and to reduce the possibility of medicine resistance developing. The number of FDC tablets is determined by a weight range for each patient at the start of treatment § Treatment is the same for HIV infected people as for non-HIV infected.  "

Recent evidence has shown that it is safe to use ethambutol in children as it has less ocular toxicity in children of all ages than previously thought. Thus ethambutol has been reintroduced in paediatric regimens.WHO (2006). Ethambutol efficacy and toxicity: literature review and recommendations for daily and intermittent dosage in children,  Treatment of new cases of TB  (Category I) All new cases of TB regardless of site, bacteriology or severity Adults:  .

" 145 n In smear positive cases, repeat sputum smear exam at end of two months. If the sputum is still positive at the end of two months the extension of the intensive phase is no longer necessary. Start continuation phase irrespective of sputum results at end of two months. n If the sputum is still smear positive at the end of two months repeat sputum smear exam at the end of month three. Sputum smear should be sent to the National TB Laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing if still smear positive after three months of treatment. A sputum sample should be collected for Gene Xpert test at the local laboratory. n Sputum testing should be collected for Gene Xpert testing and another one sent to the National TB Laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing if still smear positive after five or six months of treatment. If the patient’s sputum remains smear positive after five months of treatment (treatment failure) Category II treatment should be commenced. n Children weighing less than 11kg receive paediatric FDC HRZ plus additional isoniazid and ethambutol. n Children weighing 11kg and above receive adult formulations and additional isoniazid. n The total duration of treatment is six months. n Children with tuberculous meningitis or pericarditis, disseminated or spinal disease with neurological complications should be given 10HR (continuous phase) i.e. 10 months of isoniazid and rifampicin under direct observation. n Adults with TB of meninges, bone, joint, pericardium, disseminated, or spinal disease should be given 6 HR (continuous phase) i.e. 6 months of isoniazid and rifampicin under direct observation.

"146  n Duration of TB Course: 8 months n If at the end of the initial 3 months the sputum is smear negative or positive the continuation phase is started. n If the sputum is smear positive at three months (12 weeks), take sputum for Gene Xpert,and for culture and DST. Start the continuation phase. Consult the District/Local MDR TB Team when DST results available. Further extension of the continuation phase will not increase the chances of cure. n If a patient is still smear positive at the end of 4 months, all medicines should be stopped for 3 days and a sputum specimen sent for Gene Xpert testing and another  sputum specimen sent  to the National TB Reference Laboratory(NTBRL) in Bulawayo or National Microbiology Reference Laboratory  in Harare(NMRL) for culture and susceptibility. The patient should then be started on the continuation phase. § Patients who remain smear positive after the end of the fully supervised continuation phase will derive no benefit from another re-treatment regimen. They are termed chronic TB cases and are at high risk for medicine resistant TB.  Collect sputum for Gene Xpert as well as for culture and sensitivity. Refer to DR-TB guidelines Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB) Drug resistant TB (DR-TB) is the presence of bacilli resistant to one or more anti-tuberculosis medicines and includes multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). These are patients who remain (or again become smear positive) after completing a fully supervised re-treatment regimen.  The management of MDR or XDRTB cases is problematic; health workers should consult the MDR TB team.  Note: Although smear negative PTB and extra-pulmonary cases may also be treatment failures, relapses and DR-TB, this is a rare event and should be supported by pathological and /or bacteriological evidence. MDR TB: Following preliminary results of rifampicin resistance by gene-xpert, patients must be put on standardised Category 4 treatment of  MDR-TB whilst waiting for full DST results. Fixed Dose Combination of Anti-TB Medicines The essential anti-TB medicines now come in fixed dose combinations (FDCs) such that each tablet has 2 (2-FDC), 3 (3-FDC), or 4 (4-FDC) medicines.  Fixed dose combination tablets Fixed dose combination tablets improve compliance by reducing the number of tablets a patient has to take, and reduce the possibility of medicine resistance "
   
" 147 developing. The FDCs available in Zimbabwe are: • Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol: (RHZE) • Rifampicin, Isoniazid and Ethambutol: (RHE) • Rifampicin and Isoniazid: (RH) The number of FDC tablets is determined by a weight range for each patient at the start of treatment and this is shown in the Table 10.1 to Table 10.8.   Adverse Medicine Reaction Stop all TB medicines and assess. If necessary evaluate the liver function. Then reintroduce one medicine at a time, and build up gradually. Start with isoniazid at 25mg – the least likely to cause a reaction. When the required dose has been achieved without any reaction, another medicine should be re-introduced in a similar manner – slowly, increasing the dose daily. e.g  Day 1 Isoniazid 25mg  Day 2 Isoniazid 50mg  Day 3 Isoniazid 100mg  Day 4 Isoniazid 300mg  Day 5 Isoniazid 300mg + Rifampicin 150mg  Day 6 Isoniazid 300mg + Rifampicin 300mg   Day 7 Isoniazid 300mg + Rifampicin 450mg,  etc(Refer to the National TB Guidelines) TB and HIV Co-infection Refer to the current national ARV guidelines as well as the TB guidelines.

Bilharzia (Schistosoma mansoni & haematobium) Proper diagnosis can only be made by microscopy of urine and stools. Antibody tests alone are insufficient basis for treatment. Clinics without microscopes can treat Schistosoma haematobium infection on the basis of visible haematuria or positive urine strip test for blood and or protein in children and adolescents. Refer all suspected cases of Schistosoma mansoni for further investigations, particularly in the older patient. NB. In female patients exclude haematuria caused by menstruation S. Mansoni  Most patients with S. Mansoni infection have minimal or no symptoms unless there is heavy infestation. Infection should be suspected in young patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly or non-resolving chronic salmonella infections. Occasionally patients may present with dysentery like symptoms when colonic polyps due to S. Mansoni ulcerate and bleed. Treatment: S.

Using a 40mg/kg body weight dose, the patient should be given a dose to the nearest quarter tablet (150mg). "
   
" 155 Example: The dose for a 70 kg person is 2800 mg (70kg x 40mg). The patient should be given four and three quarter tablets (2850 mg, the closest convenient dose). Treatment with praziquantel will also have eliminated any roundworm infestation. In Mass drug/medicine administration (MDA) campaigns, a dose pole is used for administration of praziquantel.

Helminthiasis General Notes Prevention: transmission of helminths can be reduced by measures such as thorough cooking of meat and fish, use of latrines, wearing shoes, washing hands. Attention to the hands and nails is particularly important in the case of pinworm. Education to prevent re-infection is very important. The diagnosis should be confirmed by examination of stool for helminths and stool microscopy for eggs; peri-anal swab placed in saline for pinworm.  In the case of pinworm, threadworms (enterobius), the whole family should be treated. The first choice treatment for all of the above infestations is albendazole, a broad-spectrum anthelmintic. Note also that treatment of bilharzia with praziquantel would also have eliminated roundworms. Caution: Safety in pregnancy has not been established for albendazole; do NOT use in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Acute Filarial Manifestation: patients have fever, lymphangitis, lymphadenitis and relapsing lymphoedema of various body parts e.g. epididymo-orchitis in males.  Chronic stage: gross persistent lymphoedema of limbs, scrotum, breast or vulva in females.   Diagnosis: this is based on a combination of a clinico-epidemiological information and sometimes demonstration of microfilariae in a blood or fluid smear. Treatment of the acute phase involves use of Diethylcarbamazine (DEC).   Patients should be referred for specialist management. Drug therapy for chronic elephantiasis does not alter the eventual clinical outcome. Surgery for hydrocoele is indicated with local care of the limbs through daily cleaning/hygiene, elevation, exercise and use of foot ware.

"158  Leprosy  All patients should be referred to the Provincial TB/Leprosy Co-ordinator (PTBLCO) or specialist for confirmation of diagnosis. Notification is mandatory.  Classification of Leprosy Knowledge of the classification of leprosy is important for choosing the appropriate Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) regimen.  The classification can be based on clinical manifestations and/ or skin smear results.  In the classification based on skin smear results, patients showing negative smears at all sites are grouped as paucibacillary leprosy (PB), while those showing positive smears at any site are grouped as having multibacillary leprosy (MB). The clinical system of classification for the purpose of treatment includes the use of the number of lesions and nerves involved as the basis for grouping leprosy patients into MB and PB.  The clinical classification is shown below:  Classification of leprosy SITE PAUCIBACILLARY LEPROSY MULTIBACILLARY LEPROSY Skin Lesions 1-5 lesions asymmetrically distributed with definite loss of sensation  More than 5 lesions. Distributed more symmetrically. With or without loss of sensation Nerve enlargement Only one nerve trunk involved Many nerve trunks involved  Any patient showing a positive skin smear should be treated with the MDT regimen for multibacillary (MB) leprosy, irrespective of the clinical classification.  When classification is in doubt, the patient should be treated as MB leprosy. Primary Prevention Screening of family contacts should be performed.

" 159 Treatment of Multibacillary Patients Duration of therapy is now reduced to 12 months, with adequate education and follow up. § It is important to educate the patients at the time of stopping treatment about the signs and symptoms of relapse and reaction, and request them to come back immediately. § Lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patients who return not showing any improvement or with evidence of deterioration will need an additional 12 months of MDT for multibacillary leprosy. § Review patients regularly for 12months to diagnose deterioration as early as possible.  Treat with:  Medicine Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  dapsone po B V 100mg  once a day 12 months   Paed =1-2mg/kg  and clofazimine po A N 50mg  once a day 12 months   Paed = 0.5 –1mg/kg  and clofazimine po – supervised dose A N 300mg  once a month 12 months  Paed = 5-10mg/kg  and rifampicin po B V 600mg  once a month 12 months   Paed =10-15mg/kg*  *Not less than 150 mg of rifampicin.  MDT should be supplied in 28-day blister packs for ease of ordering and to avoid medicine wastage. Specific blister packs are available for children.  Reversal Reaction (Type I Reaction) This is a cell-mediated immune reaction to mycobacterium leprae.  It is characterised by swelling of skin lesions that become oedematous, red and tender.  New lesions may appear.  Peripheral nerves may become swollen and tender, with loss of sensation and paralysis in the distribution of the nerves involved.  The reactions can occur before MDT is commenced or after completion of MDT but they are commonest during the first 3 months of MDT. The full dose of antileprosy medicines must be continued in addition to treatment of the reaction.

"160  If there is no improvement consider treatment with corticosteroids. If there is evidence of neuritis (tender nerves, nerve deficit) use corticosteriods as below. Do not wait for nerve damage to appear as it may be too late for function to return. Severe Reversal Reaction A reaction in which there is also new nerve damage with loss of sensation and /or motor function in hands, feet or eyes.  ‘New’ implies additional to what the patient already had at registration or developed within the last 6 months.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) Type II reaction In this reaction immune complex formation and deposition occurs with the activation of complement. This type of reaction is characterised by crops of tender subcutaneous nodules on the face, trunk and extensor surfaces of the limbs.  It may include systemic features such as fever, lymphadenitis, orchitis, arthritis, nephritis, iridocyclitis and peripheral neuritis. Severe ENL may also present with ulcerating and pustular lesions.

Human African Trypanosomiasis:  General notes Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by the protozoa of the genus trypanosoma that is transmitted by the bite of tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is also known as sleeping sickness and has been reported from remote areas mainly from the game parks in Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland West and Matebeland North.  "
EDLIZ 2015   
"162  There are two forms of HAT: • Trypanosoma brucei rhodisiense – found in East and Southern Africa • Trypanosoma brucei gambiense – found mainly in Central and West Africa.  Clinical Presentation has 2 phases: • Acute haemolymphatic phase: presentation is with episodic bouts of fever, headache, joint pains, pruritis and anorexia. An eschar, “bite site” may be present together with local lymphadenopathy. • Delayed Neurological phase: when the parasite crosses the blood brain barrier it causes neurological signs and symptoms of sleep cycle disturbance, confusion, behavioural changes and poor coordination.  Refer all cases of Human African trypanosomiasis for specialist care. Suramin is the medicine of choice for the acute haemolyphatic phase. Melarsoprol is required if the patient progresses to the neurological phase. Typhoid Fever  Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium. A very similar but often less severe disease is caused by the Salmonella serotype paratyphi A in 10% of cases.  Humans are the only natural host and reservoir. The infection is transmitted by ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water and through direct contact with infected persons and formites (contaminated items).  Case Definition:   Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and sometimes abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea.  Clinical features The clinical presentation of typhoid fever varies from a mild illness with low grade fever, malaise and dry cough to a severe clinical picture with abdominal discomfort, altered mental status and multiple complications. Clinical diagnosis is difficult to make as it is confused with many similar conditions. In the absence of laboratory confirmation, any case of fever of at least 38 °C for 3 or more days is considered suspect if the epidemiological context is suggestive.  Depending on the clinical setting and quality of available medical care, some 5–10% of typhoid patients may develop serious complications, the most frequent being intestinal haemorrhage or peritonitis due to intestinal perforation.  Laboratory testing "
   
" 163 In Zimbabwe, blood culture samples, stool/rectal swab and bone marrow aspirate have been used to culture for isolation of S typhi. Blood culture is the usual diagnostic test locally with a sensitivity of up to 90% in the first week of onset of fever. Stool and rectal swab cultures yield positive results in up to 40% of the cases.  Case Management More than 90% of patients can be managed at home with oral antimicrobial, minimal nursing care, and close medical follow-up for complications or failure to respond to therapy.

These diseases can spread rapidly and cause outbreaks. They need closer monitoring if they are to be controlled. It is important that the health authority knows what action has been taken to control the spreading of the diseases. It is also a requirement that Zimbabwe reports cases and deaths from these diseases to the WHO (World Health Organization). While there is a longer list of diseases in the PHA, health workers are encouraged to notify the following using the T1/T2 forms:  1. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP/polio) 2. Anthrax  3. Brucellosis  4. Cholera  5. Diphtheria  6. Hepatitis (all forms)  7. Human Influenza A caused by a new subtype ( e.g. H1N1, H1N5) 8. Meningococcal Meningitis  9. Noma 10. Plague  11. Rabies  12. SARS  13. TB (Tuberculosis) and Leprosy are also notifiable, but they continue to be notified on TB Form A and TB Form B for TB, and the Leprosy form for leprosy. 14. Trypanosomiasis 15. Typhoid 16. Typhus 17. Viral Haemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola, Marburg, Crimean Congo) 18. Yellow fever 19. All such other infectious/ communicable diseases and events of public health importance as the Minster of Health & Child Care may declare by statutory instrument, to be infectious diseases throughout or in any part of Zimbabwe. These events of public health importance include maternal deaths, disasters such as chemical spillage, floods and others.   "
EDLIZ 2015   
"166  How to notify: Any health worker, including those in private sector, who comes into contact with any of the notifiable diseases. All suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of the above should be notified immediately to the District Medical Officer or City Health Director by the fastest means possible (telephone if available). The notifying health worker should then complete a T1 form in triplicate. These forms can be obtained from the offices of District Medical Officer or City Health Director upon request. "

EDLIZ 2015   
" 168 General Notes: § The pattern of malaria varies geographically. Plasmodium falciparum causes almost all the malaria in Zimbabwe. A few cases of malaria due to P.vivax, P.ovale and P.malariae may be seen.  § Complications occur mainly with P.falciparum and usually in young children, pregnant women, adults in epidemic prone areas and people moving from areas of no malaria to areas with malaria including immune compromised patients and sicklers. § Malaria usually occurs 1-6 weeks after a bite by an infected female anopheles mosquito. So it is important to take a good history and to always ask about travel and self-medication. Malaria Prevention Social and behaviour change communication on non-pharmacological means of prevention is extremely important e.g. indoor residual spraying, use of mosquito coils, repellents, long lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets, appropriate protective clothing. Medicine Prophylaxis Due to lack of evidence of efficacy on antimalarial prophylaxis in Zimbabwe coupled with suspected poor performance of the previously used medicines, personal protection is highly recommended. This is to avoid providing false sense of protection to those visiting malarious areas. Personal protection can be achieved by sleeping under a net, use of repellents when visiting a malarious area, putting on long sleeved clothes at dusk or dawn and getting indoors early. Where medicines are used, it is important to note that no medicine gives 100% protection against malaria, but medicines do reduce the risk. However, chemoprophylaxis is recommended in pregnant women as indicated below:  Malaria prophylaxis for:   Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTp)  § Pregnant women in regions of moderate to high transmission. Chemoprophilaxis in this group in based on an assumption that every pregnant woman in a malaria-endemic area is infected with malaria and has malaria parasites in the blood or in the placenta. The medication is given as treatment doses at prescribed intervals. • Three tablets of SP (each SP tablet contains Sulphadoxine 500 mg and Pyrimethamine 25 mg) are given at booking (after quickening). "
   
" 169 • Give SP to all pregnant women at each scheduled ANC visit  up to time of delivery • The doses should not be less than 4 weeks apart • SP should ideally be given as directly observe therapy of three tablets  • SP can be given on either an empty stomach or with food • SP should NOT be administered to women receiving Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis due to a higher risk of adverse effects • It is recommended that weekly folic acid also be given to pregnant woman taking IPTp. (This is done in conjuction with the Reproductive Health Department). Malaria prophylaxis for: § visitors from outside the country  May continue with the prophylaxis recommended to them before coming to Zimbabwe, but personal protection should be emphasized. Treatment of malaria All antimalarial medicines should be administered only to confirmed cases (Confirmation is done by RDT or Malaria Blood Slide). However in children less than five years treatment may be initiated whilst awaiting blood results provided other causes of fever have been clinically excluded. Malaria blood slides MUST be taken in the following cases: § Patients with severe/ complicated malaria. § Patients with treatment failure. § All referrals. § All cases where Co-artemether has been used in the preceding 2 weeks Note: Pregnant women diagnosed with malaria must receive medicine therapy immediately. Although quinine is potentially teratogenic, the benefit of giving quinine therapy far outweighs any risk.  Uncomplicated malaria The first line treatment of uncomplicated malaria is the arteminisinin combined therapy Artemether-lumefantrine (Co-artemether).

Late treatment failure is the recurrence of fever and asexual parasitaemia 7-14 days after initial successful treatment. Treatment failure may be due to: § Inadequate therapy, e.g. medicine being vomited within 30 minutes, under dosing or failure to complete the treatment. § Presence of undetected severe and complicated malaria. § Malaria parasite resistance (known or suspected) to the given medicine.

Give the equivalent dose of quinine salt orally to complete 7 days of treatment.   Cautions: Quinine may have toxic effects even at this dosage - headache, confusion, nausea, tinnitus, tremors, abdominal pain, rashes, temporary visual disturbances and reversible deafness. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur rarely. Attention should therefore be paid to the dose per body weight, and the change to oral therapy made as soon as possible. § Full size adults are generally assumed to weigh 60kg. The loading dose is therefore 1200mg and maintenance 600mg. Never exceed this dose even if the patient weighs more than 60kg. § All efforts should be made to weigh adolescents or “small adults” to avoid overdosing those who might be far less than 60kg. If weighing is not possible assume to be 45 kg. § Hypoglycaemia is an important problem with IV quinine. Monitor blood glucose 4hrly. If there is any deterioration of consciousness, hypoglycaemia should be considered. The infusion fluid (Dextrose 5%) is NOT for the specific correction of hypoglycaemia.

The duration of the quinine course may be shortened to 5 days if doxycycline is added to the therapy – see under Treatment Failure previous pages.   *IM quinine should be diluted as follows: Dilute the quinine with water for injection. Draw 8ml of water for injection into a 10ml syringe, and then draw 2ml of quinine injection into the same syringe. The syringe now contains 10ml of a concentration of 60mg of quinine salt per ml. If the volume to be injected is greater than 3ml then give half into each thigh General measures § Coma: maintain airway, nurse on side, and exclude other causes of coma, 2 hourly turns. § Convulsions: treat appropriately and check for hypoglycaemia. § Hypoglycaemia: monitor blood glucose, correct with dextrose 50% 1ml/kg (diluted 1 to 1) in children, 20-50ml in adults followed by dextrose 10% infusion. § Severe anaemia: transfusion of packed cells if HB < 6g/dl. § Acute pulmonary oedema: review fluid balance. Monitor infusion rates carefully. If over-hydrated give IV frusemide. § Acute renal failure: exclude pre-renal causes, check fluid balance, dialyse early. § Check carefully for meningitis - do a lumbar puncture if necessary. Treatment at community level  When a patient presents with signs and symptoms of severe malaria as a referral from the community health worker he/she may have been given rectal artesunate if they were unable to take any medication orally and time to get to the referral centre was more than 6 hours. • Rectal artesunate is given as follows: The dose of rectal artesunate is 10mg per Kg Body weight.  • Where the weight of the patient is not immediately known use the table below:   "

Asthma  General measures in Asthma Asthma education should be viewed as a continuous process with regular re-enforcing during patient visits to the care giver. All patients should be treated with maintenance inhaled steroids unless the patient has mild intermittent asthma as evidenced by the odd chest tightness once in every 4 months or so. Any patient with asthma who requires hospital emergency treatment or admission should be prescribed an inhaled steroid for maintenance therapy.  Attention should be paid to the following: n Domestic allergens e.g. house dust mite( carpets), cats, cockroaches n Environmental aero-allergens n Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis n Gastro-eosophageal reflux disease( GERD) n Emotional problems n Smoking n Work related dusts, fumes, vapours and gases The aims of asthma management are total control of symptoms as indicated by:  • Normal activities of life ( work, school, sports) • Normal sleep with no waking up at night (i.e. no nocturnal cough) • Normal lung function "
EDLIZ 2015   
" 192 If the above are not achievable, partial control is second best.  Uncontrolled asthma is not acceptable and warrants referral to a Specialist  Two aspects of the management of asthma in adults and children are considered here: n maintenance therapy; n treatment of acute attacks. The management of asthma in children is similar to that in adults. However, children under 18 months may not respond well to bronchodilators. Details of asthma medicine treatment in children are given below. Inhalers § All patients with chronic asthma will require inhalers. Therefore, give careful advice and check inhalation technique. Technique can be improved in most asthmatics, particularly children, by a spacer device.  § The device can be improvised as follows: cut a hole at the bottom of a 750 –1000ml plastic bottle and insert the open end of the inhaler to ensure a tight (snug) fit. Deliver one puff into the spacer and allow normal breathing for 30 seconds through the other end. All healthcare staff should be instructed in these techniques. Asthma Score § The scoring system shown below can help to assess the severity of asthma. Peak flow meters, when available, must always be used to assess the progress. Antibiotics are indicated only if there is evidence of chest infection or a fever. § Partially controlled asthma: § Day time symptoms more than twice a week § Limitation of daily activities § Nocturnal symptoms § Peak expiratory flow/FEV1 less than 80% of predicted § Exacerbations >1 per year § Use of relieving medicines( e.g. salbutamol inhaler) more than twice per week § Uncontrolled asthma: § Any 3 of the above features under partially controlled asthma  Mild Intermittent Asthma (symptoms once in 3 to 4 months)  Medicine  Codes Adult dose Frequency Duration  salbutamol inhaler C V 100–200mcg  as needed, or before exercise "

Careful monitoring of the patient’s condition is essential to assess severity, and to detect improvement or deterioration. In the absence of blood gas facilities, this will depend on close assessment of physical signs such as paradoxical breathing, the use of accessory muscles, colour, altered mental state, etc.  1. Assess the severity of asthma.  Take a careful history and examine the patient.  • Observe breathing, talking and alertness use of accessory muscles, colour, and mental status • Measure the pulse, respiratory rate, • Auscultation of the chest (assess wheezes); Measure lung function by peak flow or spirometer (PEF or FEV1) and arterial blood gases if available).

Incomplete or abbreviated courses risk development of antibiotic resistance. Persistence of H. pylori infection is indication for referral to a specialist. Preferred test for H. pylori is stool antigen test; antibody test is unreliable unless locally validated, Endoscopy-based tests are unsuitable for routine use. NSAIDs-associated ulcers When an ulcer develops, NSAID should be withdrawn wherever possible. Omeprazole at 20 mg b.d. or ranitidine 300 mg b.d. for 4 weeks.

As a minimum, get urine microscopy and an ultrasound of the kidneys for size. Are the kidneys normal sized, small, enlarged or obstructed? Obstructive Uropathy Continuous bladder catheterisation is required until the obstruction is relieved.  Relief of obstruction can result in polyuria.  Therefore, rehydrate with IV fluids.  Aim to keep up with the urine output.  Sodium and potassium supplements may be required. Scan kidneys to exclude hydronephrosis. Refer to a urologist for definitive management. Exclude prostatic enlargement in males and cancer of the cervix in women. Management of Renal Failure n First line: Exclude dehydration in all cases. Give adequate rehydration. Try fluid challenge with sodium chloride 0.9%. Should show response within hours (not days). Aim for a visible jugular venous pressure (JVP) first and then consider giving IV frusemide to encourage diuresis. n Second line: If the patient fails to respond to adequate rehydration and fluid challenge with sodium chloride 0.9% [not dextrose 5%] within 24 hours and condition is deteriorating, referral for dialysis is indicated.  If this is not possible, then aim to support patient until the kidneys recover [may take up to 6-8 weeks or more].  Monitor fluid (input and output charting) carefully. Check electrolytes regularly and maintain nutrition. Watch for infections. n Third line: Start dialysis or consult dialysis team sooner rather than later so that they can help monitor the patient. Late referrals contribute to the mortality of acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) and end-stage renal disease. Selection criteria are applied for the chronic dialysis programme and hence, each individual patient should be discussed with the dialysis team.    Fluid balance: Daily weights before breakfast.  Aim for no weight gain.  Previous day’s losses (urine, vomit etc) +500mls =day’s fluid intake. Electrolytes:  Ideally measure urea and electrolytes at least on alternate days.  Monitor potassium levels.   "

" 233 Medicines and Dialysis Dialysis may remove significant quantities of some medicines e.g. penicillins, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, methyldopa, anti-TB therapy, quinine. Therefore, give supplementary doses following a haemodialysis session. The dialysis team will advise on supplementary doses. End Stage Renal Disease/Chronic Dialysis End Stage Renal Disease:  This is said to have occurred if a patient needs dialysis for at least 3 months and thus the need for chronic dialysis may be more likely.   Chronic dialysis clients have to be selected carefully as renal replacement therapy is expensive. Clinical and psychosocial selection criteria for the chronic dialysis programme are applied and each individual patient should be discussed with the dialysis team.  Psychosocial issues may exclude the patient from the chronic dialysis programme. The goals of providing this therapy should be addressed adequately with patient and relatives. Currently dialysis entails out of pocket expenses for the patient and family. Thus ensure there has been precounselling prior to starting patient on chronic dialysis. Chronic peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis may be available in the nearest city or town but discuss with the specialist before transferring patient. Renal transplantation There is currently no renal transplantation in Zimbabwe but some patients have had living related donor kidney transplantation outside this country at their own expense or that of their medical aid society.

" 241 Diabetes Mellitus There are two main types of diabetes mellitus: Type 1 § Usually under 30 years but can present at any age, present acutely, with weight loss and ketonuria: treated with diet and insulin. Type 2 § Usually over 30 years, insidious onset, frequently obese: treated with diet and oral anti-diabetic agents. 40% will eventually require insulin treatment. Weight reduction is crucial. Dietary control and weight loss plays an important part in the management of diabetes mellitus. Many type 2 diabetics are overweight. Reducing body weight through careful control of energy intake and physical activity like walking helps to control the symptoms of diabetes. Most people with diabetes who are properly informed and managed soon become experts in their own care.
