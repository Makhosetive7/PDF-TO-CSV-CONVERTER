Otitis externa
Acute otitis externa characteristically produces moderate to severe pain that's exacerbated by 
"manipulating the auricle or tragus, clenching the teeth, opening the mouth, or chewing. Its other clinical "
"effects may include fever, foul-smelling discharge, crusting in the external ear, regional cellulitis, partial "
"hearing loss, and itching. It's usually difficult to view the tympanic membrane because of pain in the "
external canal.Hearing acuity is normal unless complete occlusion has occurred.Fungal otitis externa may
"be asymptomatic, although A. niger produces a black or gray, blotting, paperlike growth in the ear canal. "
"In chronic otitis externa, pruritus replaces pain, and scratching may lead to scaling and skin thickening. "
Aural discharge may also occur.
Benign tumors of the ear canal
"A benign ear tumor is usually asymptomatic, unless it becomes infected, in which case pain, fever, or "
inflammation may result. (Pain is usually a sign of a malignant tumor.) If the tumor grows large enough to
"obstruct the ear canal by itself or through accumulated cerumen and debris, it may cause hearing loss "
and the sensation of pressure.
Otitis media
"Clinical features of acute suppurative otitis media include severe, deep, throbbing pain (from pressure "
behind the tympanic membrane); signs of upper respiratory tract infection (sneezing or coughing); mild 
to very high fever; hearing loss (usually mild and conductive); tinnitus; dizziness; nausea; and vomiting. 
"Other possible effects include bulging of the tympanic membrane, with concomitant erythema, and "
"purulent drainage in the ear canal from tympanic membrane rupture. However, many patients are "
asymptomatic.Acute secretory otitis media produces a severe conductive hearing loss—which varies 
"from 15 to 35 dB, depending on the thickness and amountof fluid in the middle ear cavity—and, "
"possibly, a sensation of fullness in  the ear and popping, crackling,  or clicking sounds on swallowing or "
with jaw movement. Accumulation of  fluid may also cause the patient to hear an echo when he speaks 
and to experience a vague feeling of top-heaviness.The cumulative effects of chronic otitis media include 
"thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent tympanic  membrane mobility, "
"cholesteatoma (a cystlike mass in the middle ear)  and, in chronic suppurative otitis media, a painless, "
purulent discharge.The extent of associated conductive hearing loss varies with the size and  type of 
"tympanic membrane perforation and ossicular destruction.  If the tympanic membrane has ruptured, the "
"patient may state that the  pain has suddenly stopped. Complications may include abscesses (brain,  "
"subperiosteal, and epidural), sigmoid sinus or jugular vein thrombosis,septicemia, meningitis, "
"suppurative labyrinthitis, facial paralysis, andotitis externa."
Mastoiditis
"Primary clinical features include a dull ache and tenderness in the area  of the mastoid process, low-"
"grade fever, headache, and a thick, purulent  discharge that gradually becomes more profuse, possibly "
leading to otitis externa. Postauricular erythema and edema may push the auricle out  from the head; 
pressure within the edematous mastoid antrum may  produce swelling and obstruction of the external 
"ear canal, causing conductive hearing loss."
Otosclerosis
"Spongy bone in the otic capsule immobilizes the footplate of the  normally mobile stapes, disrupting the "
conduction of vibrations from the  tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This causes progressive unilateral  
"hearing loss, which may advance to bilateral deafness. Other symptoms  include tinnitus and paracusis of "
Willis (hearing conversation better in a  noisy environment than in a quiet one).
Infectious myringitis
"Acute infectious myringitis begins with severe ear pain, commonly  accompanied by tenderness over the "
"mastoid process. Small, reddened,  inflamed blebs form in the canal, on the tympanic membrane and, "
"with bacterial invasion, in the middle ear. Fever and hearing loss are rare  unless fluid accumulates in the "
"middle ear, or a large bleb totally  obstructs the external auditory meatus. Spontaneous rupture of these  "
"blebs may cause bloody discharge. Chronic granular myringitis produces  pruritus, purulent discharge, "
and gradual hearing loss.
Ménière's disease
"Ménière's disease produces three characteristic effects: severe episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and "
sensorineural hearing loss. A feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear is also common. Violent 
"paroxysmal attacks last from 10 minutes to several hours. During an acute attack, other symptoms "
"include severe nausea, vomiting, sweating, giddiness, and nystagmus. Vertigo may cause loss of balance "
and falling to the affected side. Symptoms tend to wax and wane as the endolymphatic pressure rises 
"and falls. To lessen these symptoms, the patient may assume a characteristic posture—lying on the side "
"of the unaffected ear and  looking in the direction of the affected ear.  Initially, the patient may be "
"asymptomatic between attacks, except for  residual tinnitus that worsens during an attack. Such attacks "
"may occur several times a year, or remissions may last as long as several years.  These attacks become "
less frequent as hearing loss progresses (usually  unilaterally); they may cease when hearing loss is total. 
All symptoms are aggravated by motion.
Labyrinthitis
"Because the inner ear controls both hearing and balance, this infection  typically produces severe vertigo "
(with any movement of the head) and  sensorineural hearing loss. Vertigo begins gradually but peaks 
"within 48 hours, causing loss of balance and falling in the direction of the affected  ear. Other associated "
"signs and symptoms include spontaneous  nystagmus, with jerking movements of the eyes toward the "
"unaffected ear, and nausea, vomiting, and giddiness. With cholesteatoma, signs of  middle ear disease "
"may appear. With severe bacterial infection, purulent  drainage, increased salivation, generalized malaise,"
"and perspiration can  occur. To minimize symptoms such as giddiness and nystagmus, the  patient may "
assume a characteristic posture —lying on the side of the  unaffected ear and looking in the direction of 
the affected ear.
Hearing loss
"Sudden deafness may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed, depending  on etiology. Associated clinical "
"features depend on the underlying cause.  Noise-induced hearing loss causes sensorineural damage, the "
"extent of which depends on the duration and intensity of the noise. Initially, the  patient loses perception "
"of certain frequencies (around 4,000 Hz) but,  with continued exposure, eventually loses perception of all "
frequencies.
Motion sickness
"Typically, motion sickness induces nausea, vomiting, headache,dizziness, fatigue, diaphoresis and, "
"occasionally, difficulty in breathing,leading to a sensation of suffocation. These symptoms usually subside"
"when the precipitating stimulus is removed, but they may persist for  several hours or days."
Epistaxis
Blood oozing from the nostrils usually originates in the anterior nose and  is bright red. Blood from the 
back of the throat originates in the  posterior area and may be dark or bright red (commonly mistaken for
"hemoptysis due to expectoration).  Epistaxis is generally unilateral, except when it's due to dyscrasia or  "
"severe trauma. In severe epistaxis, blood may seep behind the nasal  septum; it may also appear in the "
middle ear and in the corners of the  eyes. Associated clinical effects depend on the severity of bleeding. 
"Moderate blood loss may produce light-headedness, dizziness, and slight  respiratory difficulty; severe "
"hemorrhage causes hypotension, rapid and  bounding pulse, dyspnea, and pallor. Bleeding is considered "
severe if it persists longer than 10 minutes after pressure is applied and causes  blood loss as great as 1 
L/hour in adults. Exsanguination (bleeding to  death) from epistaxis is rare.
Septal perforation and deviation
A small septal perforation is usually asymptomatic but may produce a  whistle on inspiration. A large 
"perforation causes rhinitis, epistaxis,  nasal crusting, and watery discharge.The patient with a deviated "
"septum may develop a crooked nose, as the  midline deflects to one side. The predominant symptom of "
"severe deflection, however, is nasal obstruction. Other manifestations include a  sensation of fullness in "
"the face, shortness of breath, stertor (snoring or  laborious breathing), nasal discharge, recurring "
"epistaxis, infection, sinusitis, and headache."
Sinusitis
"The primary indication of acute sinusitis is nasal congestion, followed by  a gradual buildup of pressure in "
"the affected sinus. For 24 to 48 hours  after onset, nasal discharge may be present and later may become  "
"purulent. Associated symptoms include malaise, sore throat, headache,and low-grade fever of 99° to "
99.5° F [37.2° to 37.5° C]).Characteristic pain depends on the affected sinus: maxillary sinusitis causes 
"pain over the cheeks and upper teeth; ethmoid sinusitis, pain over the eyes; frontal sinusitis, pain over "
"the eyebrows; and sphenoid sinusitis (rare), pain behind the eyes. (See Locating the paranasal sinuses.) "
Purulent nasal drainage that continues for longer than 3 weeks after an acute infection subsides suggests
"subacute sinusitis. Other clinical features of the subacute form include nasal congestion, vague facial "
"discomfort, fatigue, and a nonproductive cough. The effects of chronic sinusitis are similar to those of "
"acute sinusitis, but the chronic form causes continuous mucopurulent discharge."
Nasal polyps
"Nasal obstruction is the primary indication of nasal polyps. Such obstruction causes anosmia, a sensation"
"of fullness in the face, nasal discharge, headache, and shortness of breath. Associated clinical features "
are usually the same as those of allergic rhinitis.
Nasal papillomas
Both inverted and exophytic papillomas typically produce symptoms related to unilateral nasal 
"obstruction—congestion, postnasal drip,headache, shortness of breath, dyspnea and, rarely, severe "
"respiratory distress, nasal drainage, and infection. Epistaxis is most likely to occur  with exophytic "
papillomas. Occasionally hemorrhage may be the  presenting symptom.
Adenoid hyperplasia
"Typically, adenoid hyperplasia produces symptoms of respiratory  obstruction, especially mouth "
"breathing, snoring at night, and frequent,  prolonged nasal congestion. Persistent mouth breathing during"
the formative years produces voice alteration and distinctive changes in  facial features—a slightly 
"elongated face, open mouth, highly arched  palate, shortened upper lip, and vacant expression."
Velopharyngeal insufficiency
"Generally, this condition causes unintelligible speech, marked by  hypernasality, nasal emission, poor "
"consonant definition, and a weak  voice. The patient experiences dysphagia and, if velopharyngeal  "
"insufficiency is severe, he may regurgitate through the nose."
Pharyngitis
Pharyngitis produces a sore throat and slight difficulty in swallowing.  Swallowing saliva is usually more 
painful than swallowing food.  Pharyngitis may also cause the sensation of a lump in the throat as well  as 
"a constant, aggravating urge to swallow. Associated features may  include mild fever, headache, muscle "
"and joint pain, coryza, and  rhinorrhea. Uncomplicated pharyngitis usually subsides in 3 to 10 days."
Tonsillitis
"Acute tonsillitis commonly begins with a mild to severe sore throat. A  very young child, unable to "
"describe a sore throat, may stop eating.Tonsillitis may also produce dysphagia, fever, swelling and "
"tenderness of the lymph glands in the submandibular area, muscle and joint pain,  chills, malaise, "
"headache, and pain (frequently referred to the ears).Excess secretions may elicit the complaint of a "
constant urge to swallow; the back of the throat may feel constricted. Such discomfort  usually subsides 
after 72 hours. Chronic tonsillitis produces a recurrent sore throat and purulent  drainage in the tonsillar 
crypts. Frequent attacks of acute tonsillitis may  also occur. Complications include obstruction from 
tonsillar hypertrophy  and peritonsillar abscess.
Throat abscesses
"Key symptoms of peritonsillar abscess include severe throat pain,occasional ear pain on the same side as"
"the abscess, and tenderness of  the submandibular gland. Dysphagia causes drooling. Trismus may occur  "
as a result of the spread of edema and infection from the peritonsillar  space to the pterygoid muscles. 
"Other effects include fever, chills,malaise, rancid breath, nausea, muffled speech, dehydration, cervical  "
"adenopathy, and localized or systemic sepsis.  Clinical features of retropharyngeal abscess include pain, "
"dysphagia, fever and, when the abscess is located in the upper pharynx, nasal  obstruction; with a "
"lowpositioned abscess, dyspnea, progressive  inspiratory stridor (from laryngeal obstruction), neck "
"hyperextension and, in children, drooling and muffled crying occur. Other symptoms in children  may "
"include gurgling respirations, dyspnea and dysphagia, respiratory  symptoms, and fever. A very large "
"abscess may press on the larynx,  causing edema, or may erode into major vessels, causing sudden death  "
from asphyxia or aspiration.
Vocal cord paralysis
"Unilateral paralysis, the most common form, may cause vocal weakness  and hoarseness. Bilateral "
paralysis typically produces vocal weakness  and incapacitating airway obstruction if the cords become 
paralyzed in the adducted position.
Vocal cord nodules and polyps
Nodules and polyps inhibit the approximation of vocal cords and produce  painless hoarseness. The voice 
may also develop a breathy or husky  quality
Laryngitis
"Acute laryngitis typically begins with hoarseness, ranging from mild to  complete loss of voice. Associated"
"clinical features include pain  (especially when swallowing or speaking), a persistent dry cough, fever,  "
"laryngeal edema, and malaise. In chronic laryngitis, persistent  hoarseness is usually the only symptom."
Juvenile angiofibroma
"Juvenile angiofibroma produces unilateral or bilateral nasal obstruction  and severe recurrent epistaxis, "
usually between ages 7 and 21.  Recurrent epistaxis eventually causes secondary anemia. Associated  
"effects include purulent rhinorrhea, facial deformity, and nasal speech.  Serous otitis media and hearing "
loss may result from eustachian tube  obstruction.
Blepharitis  
" Clinical features of blepharitis include itching, burning, foreign-body sensation, and sticky, "
crusted eyelids on waking. This constant irritation results in unconscious rubbing of the eyes (cau sing 
reddened rims) or continual blinking. Other signs include waxy scales in seborrheic blepharitis; and  flaky 
"scales on lashes, loss of lashes, and ulcerated areas on lid margins in ulcerative blepharitis. In associatio n "
"with KCS, dry eyes may also be a problem.  "
Exophthalmos  
"The obvious effect is a bulging eyeball, commonly with diplopia, if extraocular muscle ed ema causes "
misalignment. (See Recognizing exophthalmos.) A rim of the sclera may be visible below the  upper lid as 
"lid retraction occurs, and the patient may blink infrequently. Other symptoms depend on the cause: pain  "
may accompany traumatic exophthalmos; a tumor may produce conjunctival hyperemi a or chemosis; 
retraction of the upper lid predisposes to exposure keratitis. If exophthalmos is associated with 
"cavernous sinus thrombosis, the patient may exhibit paresis of the muscles supplied by cranial nerves III, "
"IV, and VI; limited ocular movement; and a septictype (high) fever.  "
Ptosis  
"An infant with congenital ptosis has a smooth, flat upper eyelid, without the eyelid fold normall y caused "
by the pull of the levator muscle; associated weakness of the superior rectus muscle isn't uncommon. 
The child with unilateral ptosis that covers the pupil can develop an amblyopic eye from disuse  or lack of 
"eye stimulation. In bilateral ptosis, the child may elevate his brow in an attempt to co mpensate, "
"wrinkling his forehead in an effort to raise the upper lid. Also, the child may tilt his head backward to "
"see. In myasthenia gravis, ptosis results from fatigue and characteristically appears in the evening, but is "
"relieved by rest. Ptosis due to oculomotor nerve damage produces a fixed, dilated pupil;  divergent "
strabismus; and slight depression of the eyeball. 
Orbital cellulitis  
"Orbital cellulitis generally produces unilateral eyelid edema, hyperemia of the orbital tissues,  reddened "
"eyelids, and matted lashes. Although the eyeball is initially unaffected, proptosis develops lat er (because "
of edematous tissues within the bony confines of the orbit). Other indications include extre me orbital 
"pain, impaired eye movement, chemosis, and purulent discharge from indurated areas. The severity of "
"associated systemic symptoms (chills, fever, and malaise) varies according to the cause. Com plications "
"include posterior extension, causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, panophthalmitis, mening itis, or brain "
"abscess and, rarely, atrophy and subsequent loss of vision secondary to optic neuritis.  "
Dacryocystitis  
Dacryocystitis is extremely painful for the patient. The hallmark of both the acute and chronic forms of 
dacryocystitis is constant tearing. Other symptoms of dacryocystitis include inflammation and 
tenderness over the nasolacrimal sac; pressure over this area may fail to produce purulent discharg e 
from the punctum.  
Chalazion  
"A chalazion occurs as a painless, hard lump that usually points toward the conjunctival side o f the eyelid. "
"Eversion of the lid reveals a red or red-yellow elevated area on the conjunctival surface. Otherwi se, it's "
seen as an indurated bump under the skin of the upper eyelid.  
Stye  
"Typically, a stye produces redness, swelling, and pain. An abscess frequently forms at the lid margin, w ith "
"an eyelash pointing outward from its center. A stye is a localized red, swollen, and tender abscess of the "
lid glands. 
Inclusion conjunctivitis  
Inclusion conjunctivitis develops 5 to 12 days after contamination (it takes longer to  develop than 
"gonococcal ophthalmia). In a neonate, reddened eyelids and tearing with moderate mucoid  discharge "
"are presenting symptoms. In neonates, pseudomembranes may form, which can lead to conjunctival "
"scarring. In adults, follicles appear inside the lower eyelids; such follicles don't form in infants becaus e "
the lymphoid tissue isn't yet well developed. Children and adults also develop preauricular 
"lymphadenopathy, and children may develop otitis media as a complication. Inclusion con junctivitis may "
"persist for weeks or months, possibly with superficial corneal involvement.  "
Conjunctivitis  
"Conjunctivitis commonly produces hyperemia of the conjunctiva, sometimes accompani ed by discharge, "
"tearing and, with corneal involvement, pain and photophobia. It generally doesn't affect vision. "
"Conjunctivitis usually begins in one eye and rapidly spreads to the other by contamination of towe ls, "
"washcloths, or the patient's own hand. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) usually lasts only 2 weeks. "
"The patient typically complains of itching, burning, and the sensation of a foreign body in his e ye. The "
"eyelids show a crust of sticky, mucopurulent discharge. If the disorder is due to N. gonorrhoeae , "
"however, the patient exhibits a profuse, purulent discharge. Viral conjunctivitis produces copi ous tearing "
"with minimal exudate, and enlargement of the preauricular lymph node. Some viruses follow a chr onic "
course and produce severe disabling disease; others last 2 to 3 weeks and are self-limiting.Itching  is the 
hallmark of allergy. Giant papillae resembling cobblestones may be seen on the palpebral conjun ctiva 
Trachoma  
"Trachoma begins with a mild infection resembling bacterial conjunctivitis (visible conjun ctival follicles, "
"red and edematous eyelids, pain, photophobia, tearing, and exudation). After about 1 month, if t he "
"infection is untreated, conjunctival follicles enlarge into inflamed papillae that lat er become yellow or "
"gray. At this stage, small blood vessels invade the cornea under the upper lid.Eventually, severe scarrin g "
and contraction of the eyelids cause entropion; the eyelids turn inward and the lashes rub against the 
"cornea, producing corneal scarring and visual distortion. In late stages, severe conjunctival scarri ng may "
obstruct the lacrimal ducts and cause dry eyes. 
Keratitis  
"Keratitis is usually unilateral. The patient presents with decreased vision, discomfort ranging from mild "
"irritation to acute pain, tearing, and photophobia. On gross examination with a penlight, the co rneal light "
"reflex may appear distorted. When keratitis results from exposure, it usually affects the lower portion of "
the cornea. 
Corneal abrasion  
"A corneal abrasion typically produces redness, increased tearing, discomfort with blinking, a sensation o f "
"“something in the eye ” and, because the cornea is richly endowed with nerve endings from the "
"trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), pain disproportionate to the size of the injury. It may al so affect visual "
"acuity, depending on the size and location of the injury.  "
Corneal ulcers  
"Typically, corneal ulceration begins with pain (aggravated by blinking) and photophobia, foll owed by "
"increased tearing. Eventually, central corneal ulceration produces pronounced visual blurring. The eye "
"may appear injected. If a bacterial ulcer is present, purulent discharge is possible. "
Uveitis  
Anterior uveitis produces moderate to severe unilateral eye pain; severe ciliary injecti on; photophobia; 
"tearing; a small, nonre-active pupil; and blurred vision (due to the increased numb er of cells in the "
"aqueous humor). It sometimes produces deposits called keratic precipitates on the back of the cornea, "
"which may be seen in the anterior chamber. The iris may adhere to the lens, causing posterior synechia e "
and pupillary distortion; pain and photophobia may occur. Onset may be acute or insidious. P osterior 
"uveitis begins insidiously, with complaints of slightly decreased or blurred vision or flo ating spots. "
"Posterior uveitis may be acute or chronic, and it may affect one or both eyes. Retinal damag e caused by "
lesions from toxoplasmosis and retinal detachments may occur. Refer the patient to an ophthalmol ogist 
for dilated fundus examination and treatment for local systemic diseases 
Retinal detachment  
"Initially, the patient may complain of floating spots and recurrent flashes of light (photopsia). Howev er, "
"as detachment progresses, gradual, painless vision loss may be described as a veil, curtain, or cobweb "
that eliminates a portion of the visual field.  
Vascular retinopathies  
"Central retinal artery occlusion produces sudden, painless, unilateral loss of vision (partial or co mplete). "
It may follow amaurosis fugax or transient episodes of unilateral loss of vision lasting  from a few seconds 
"to minutes, probably due to vasospasm. This condition typically causes permanent blindness. However, "
some patients experience spontaneous resolution within hours and regain partial vision. Central retinal  
"vein occlusion causes reduced visual acuity, allowing perception of only hand movement and li ght. This "
"condition is painless, except when it results in secondary neovascular glaucoma (uncontrol led "
proliferation of weak blood vessels). The prognosis is poor —some patients with this condition develop 
secondary glaucoma within 3 to 4 months after occlusion. Nonproliferative diabeti c retinopathy 
produces changes in the lining of the retinal blood vessels that cause the vessels to leak plas ma or fatty 
"substances, which decrease or block blood flow (nonperfusion) within the retina. This disorder may also "
produce microaneurysms and small hemorrhages. Nonproliferative retinopathy causes no sympto ms in 
"some patients; in others, leakage of fluid into the macular region causes significant loss o f central visual "
acuity (necessary for reading and driving) and diminished night vision. 
Age-related macular degeneration  
"The patient notices a change in central vision. Initially, straight lines (for example, of buil dings) become "
"distorted; later, a blank area appears in the center of a printed page (central scotoma).  "
Cataract  
"Characteristically, a patient with a cataract experiences painless, gradual blurring and loss of vision. A s "
"the cataract progresses, the normally black pupil appears hazy, and when a mature cataract develops, "
the white lens may be seen through the pupil. Some patients complain of blinding glare from h eadlights 
"when they drive at night; others complain of poor reading vision, and of an unpleasant glare an d poor "
vision in bright sunlight. Patients with central opacities report better vision in dim ligh t than in bright 
"light because the cataract is nuclear and, as the pupils dilate, patients can see around the lens opacity.  "
Retinitis pigmentosa  
"Typically, night blindness occurs while the patient is in his teens. As the disease progresses, his v isual "
"field gradually constricts, causing tunnel or “gun-barrel ” vision. Many people retain this tunnel of useful "
vision until quite late in life. The speed of vision loss varies considerably from person to perso n. 
"However, blindness follows invasion of the macular region. "
Optic atrophy  
"Optic atrophy causes abrupt or gradual painless loss of visual field or visual acuity, with subtle changes in "
color vision.  
Extraocular motor nerve palsies  
"The most characteristic clinical effect of extraocular motor nerve palsies is diplopia of recent  onset, "
"which varies in different visual fields, depending on the muscles affected. Typically, the patient wi th third "
"nerve palsy exhibits ptosis, exotropia (eye looks outward), pupil dilation, and unresponsi veness to light; "
the eye is unable to move and can't accommodate. The patient with fourth nerve palsy display s diplopia 
and an inability to rotate the eye downward or upward. The head is tilted to the side opp osite the 
involved area in superior oblique palsy. Sixth nerve palsy causes one eye to turn; the eye can' t abduct 
"beyond the midline. To compensate for diplopia, the patient turns his head to the unaffected side and "
can develop torticollis. 
Glaucoma  
"Chronic open-angle glaucoma is usually bilateral, with insidious onset and a slowly prog ressive course. "
"Symptoms appear late in the disease and include mild aching in the eyes, loss of peripheral vision, seei ng "
"halos around lights, and reduced visual acuity (especially at night) that isn't correctable wi th glasses. "
"Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically has a rapid onset, constituting an ophthalmic emergency. "
"Symptoms include acute pain in a unilaterally inflamed eye, with pressure over the eye, moderate pup il "
"dilation that's nonreactive to light, a cloudy cornea, blurring and decreased visual acuity, photo phobia, "
"and seeing halos around lights. Increased IOP may induce nausea and vomiting, which may cause "
"glaucoma to be misinterpreted as GI distress. Unless treated promptly, this acute form of glaucoma "
produces blindness in 3 to 5 days.  
 
 
 
Stomatitis and other oral infections  
"Acute herpetic stomatitis begins suddenly with mouth pain, malaise, lethargy, anorexia, irritability, "
"and fever, which may persist for 1 to 2 weeks. Gums are swollen and bleed easily, and the mucous "
membrane is extremely tender. Papulovesicular ulcers appear in the mouth and throat and 
eventually become punched -out lesions with reddened areolae. Submaxillary lymphadenitis is 
common. Pain usually disappears 2 to 4 days before healing of ulcers is complete. If the child with 
"stomatitis sucks his thumb, these lesions spread to the hand. P A patient with aphthous stomatitis "
"typically reports burning, tingling, and slight swelling of the mucous membrane. Single or multiple "
shallow ulcers with whitish centers and red bo rders appear and heal at one site and then reappear 
at another.  
Gastroesophageal reflux  
"GERD doesn't always cause symptoms, and in patients showing clinical effects, it isn't always "
"possible to confirm physiologic reflux. The most common feature of GER D is heartburn, which may "
"become more severe with vigorous exercise, bending, or lying down, and may be relieved by "
antacids or sitting upright. The pain of esophageal spasm resulting from reflux esophagitis tends to 
"be chronic and may mimic angina pectori s, radiating to the neck, jaws, and arms. Other symptoms "
"include odynophagia, which may be followed by a dull substernal ache from severe, long -term "
"reflux; dysphagia from esophageal spasm, stricture, or esophagitis; and bleeding (bright red or dark "
"brown) . Rarely, nocturnal regurgitation wakens the patient with coughing, choking, and a mouthful "
of saliva. Reflux may be associated with hiatal hernia. Direct hiatal hernia becomes clinically 
significant only when reflux is confirmed. Pulmonary symptoms result  from reflux of gastric contents 
into the throat and subsequent aspiration; they include chronic pulmonary disease or nocturnal 
"wheezing, bronchitis, asthma, morning hoarseness, and cough. In children, other signs consist of "
failure to thrive and forceful vomiting from esophageal irritation. Such vomiting sometimes causes 
aspiration pneumonia.  
Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia  
A neonate with type C tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia appears to swallow 
"normally but soon afte r swallowing coughs, struggles, becomes cyanotic, and stops breathing as he "
aspirates fluids returning from the blind pouch of the esophagus through his nose and mouth. 
Stomach distention may cause respiratory distress; air and gastric contents (bile and g astric 
"secretions) may reflux through the fistula into the trachea, resulting in chemical pneumonitis. An "
"infant with type A esophageal atresia appears normal at birth. The infant swallows normally, but as "
"secretions fill the esophageal sac and overflow in to the oropharynx, he develops mucus in the "
"oropharynx and drools excessively. When the infant is fed, regurgitation and respiratory distress "
follow aspiration. Suctioning the mucus and secretions temporarily relieves these symptoms. 
Excessive secretions a nd drooling in the neonate strongly suggest esophageal atresia. Repeated 
"episodes of pneumonitis, pulmonary infection, and abdominal distention may signal type E (or H -"
"type) tracheoesophageal fistula. When a child with this disorder drinks, he coughs, chok es, and "
becomes cyanotic. Excessive mucus builds up in the oropharynx. Crying forces air from the trachea 
"into the esophagus, producing abdominal distention. Because such a child may appear normal at "
"birth, this type of P tracheoesophageal fistula may be o verlooked, and diagnosis may be delayed as "
long as 1 year. Type B (proximal fistula) and type D (fistula to both segments) cause immediate 
aspiration of saliva into the airway and bacterial pneumonitis.  
 
Corrosive esophagitis and stricture  
"Effects vary from none at all to intense pain and edema n the mouth, anterior chest pain, marked "
"salivation, inability to swallow, and tachypnea. Bloody vomitus containing pieces of esophageal "
"tissue signals severe damage. Signs of esophageal perforation and mediastini tis, especially "
"crepitation, indicate destruction of the entire esophagus. Inability to speak implies laryngeal "
"damage. The acute phase subsides in 3 to 4 days, enabling the patient to eat again. Fever suggests "
"secondary infection. Symptoms of dysphagia re turn P if stricture develops, usually within weeks; "
"rarely, stricture is delayed and develops several years after the injury.  "
Mallory -Weiss syndrome  
Mallory -Weiss syndrome typically begins with vomiting of blood or passing large amounts of blood 
"rectal ly a few hours to several days after forceful vomiting. The bleeding, which may be "
"accompanied by epigastric or back pain, may range from mild to massive, but is usually more profuse "
"than in esophageal rupture. In Mallory -Weiss syndrome, the blood vessels are only partially severed, "
preventing retraction and closure of the lumen.  
Esophageal diverticula  
Midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula with an associated motor disturbance (achalasia or 
"spasm) seldom produce symptoms, although the patient may experience dysphagia and heartburn. "
"Zenker's diverticulum, however, produces di stinctly staged symptoms, beginning with initial throat "
"irritation followed by dysphagia and near -complete obstruction. In early stages, regurgitation occurs "
"soon after eating; in later stages, regurgitation after eating is delayed and may even occur durin g "
"sleep, leading to food aspiration and pulmonary infection. ELDER TIP Hoarseness, asthma, and "
pneumonitis may be the only signs of esophageal diverticula in elderly patients. Other signs and 
"symptoms include noise when liquids are swallowed, chronic cough , hoarseness, a bad taste in the "
"mouth or foul breath and, rarely, bleeding.  "
Hiatal hernia  
"Typically, a paraesophageal hernia produces no symptoms; it's usually an incidental finding during a "
barium swallow or when testing for occult blood. Because thi s type of hernia leaves the closing 
"mechanism of the cardiac sphincter unchanged, it rarely causes acid reflux or reflux esophagitis. "
Symptoms result from displacement or stretching of the stomach and may include a feeling of 
"fullness in the chest or pain resembling angina pectoris. Even if it produces no symptoms, this type "
of hernia needs surgical treatment because of the high risk of strangulation that can occur when a 
large portion of stomach becomes caught above the diaphragm. A sliding hernia without an 
"incompetent sphincter produces no reflux or symptoms and, consequently, doesn't require "
"treatment. When a sliding hernia causes symptoms, they are typical of gastric reflux, resulting from "
"the incompetent lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and may includ e the following: P Pyrosis "
"(heartburn) occurs 1 to 4 hours after eating (especially overeating) and is aggravated by reclining, "
"belching, and increased intra -abdominal pressure. It may be accompanied by regurgitation or "
"vomiting. Retrosternal or substernal  chest pain results from reflux of gastric contents, stomach "
"distention, and spasm or altered motor activity. Chest pain usually occurs after meals or at bedtime "
"and is aggravated by reclining, belching, and increased intra -abdominal pressure. Other common  "
"symptoms reflect possible complications: Dysphagia occurs when the hernia produces esophagitis, "
"esophageal ulceration, or stricture, especially with ingestion of very hot or cold foods, alcoholic "
"beverages, or a large amount of food. Bleeding may be mild or massive, frank or occult; the source "
"may be esophagitis or erosions of the gastric pouch. Severe pain and shock result from incarceration, "
in which a large portion of the stomach is caught above the diaphragm (usually occurs with 
paraesophageal hernia).  Incarceration may lead to perforation of the gastric ulcer and strangulation 
and gangrene of the herniated portion of the stomach. It requires immediate surgery.  
Gastritis  
"After exposure to the offending substance, the patient with acute gastritis typically reports a rapid "
"onset of symptoms, such as epigastric discomfort, indigestion, cramping, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, "
and hematemesis. The symptoms last from a few hours to a few days. The patient with chronic 
"gastritis may describe simi lar symptoms or may have only mild epigastric discomfort, or his "
"complaints may be vague, such as an intolerance for spicy or fatty foods or slight pain relieved by "
eating. The patient with chronic atrophic gastritis may be asymptomatic.  
Gastroenteritis  
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the pathologic organism and on the level of GI tract 
"involved. However, gastroenteritis in adults is usually an acute, self -limiting, nonfatal disease "
"producing diarrhea, abdominal discomfort (ranging from cramping to  pain), nausea, and vomiting. "
"Other possible signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, and borborygmi. In children, the elderly, "
"and the debilitated, gastroenteritis produces the same symptoms, but these patients' intolerance to "
electrolyte and fluid loss es leads to a higher mortality.  
Peptic ulcers  
Heartburn and indigestion usually signal the beginning of a gastric ulcer attack. Eating stretches the 
"gastric wall and may cause or, in some cases, relieve pain and feelings of fullness and distention. "
Other typical effects include weight loss and repeated episodes of massive GI bleeding. Duodenal 
"ulcers produce heartburn, well -localized midepigastric pain (relieved by food), weight gain (because "
"the patient eats to relieve discomfort), and a peculiar sensa tion of hot water bubbling in the back of "
"the throat. Attacks usually occur about 2 hours after meals, whenever the stomach is empty, or after "
"consumption of orange juice, coffee, aspirin, or alcohol. Exacerbations tend to recur several times "
per year and then fade into remission. Vomiting and other digestive disturbances are rare. Ulcers 
may penetrate the pancreas and cause severe back pain. Other complications of peptic ulcers 
"include perforation, hemorrhage, and pyloric obstruction. Ulcers may, on occasi on, produce no "
symptoms.  
Ulcerative colitis  
"The hallmark of ulcerative colitis is recurrent attacks of bloody diarrhea, in many cases containing "
"pus and mucus, interspersed with asymptomatic remissions. The intensity of these attacks varies "
with the ex tent of inflammation. It isn't uncommon for a patient with ulcerative colitis to have as 
"many as 15 to 20 liquid, bloody stools daily. Other symptoms include spastic rectum and anus, "
"abdominal pain, irritability, weight loss, weakness, anorexia, nausea, an d vomiting. Ulcerative colitis "
"may lead to complications, such as hemorrhage, stricture, or perforation of the colon. Other "
"complications include joint inflammation, ankylosing spondylitis, eye lesions, mouth ulcers, liver "
"disease, and pyoderma gangrenosum . Scientists think that these complications occur when the "
immune system triggers inflammation in other parts of the body. These disorders are usually mild 
and disappear when the colitis is treated. Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk o f 
developing colorectal cancer; children with ulcerative colitis may experience impaired growth and 
sexual development.  
 
Necrotizing enterocolitis  
Neonates who have suffered from perinatal hypoxemia have the potential for developing NEC. A 
distended (es pecially tense or rigid) abdomen with gastric retention is the earliest and most 
"common sign of oncoming NEC, which usually appears 1 to 10 days after birth. Other clinical "
"features are increasing residual gastric contents (which may contain bile), bile -stained vomitus, and "
"occult blood in the stool. About 25% of patients have bloody diarrhea. A red or shiny, taut abdomen "
"may indicate peritonitis. Nonspecific signs and symptoms include thermal instability, lethargy, "
"metabolic acidosis, jaundice, and DIC. Th e major complication is perforation, which requires surgery. "
"Recurrence of NEC and mechanical and functional abnormalities of the intestine, especially stricture, "
are P the usual cause of residual intestinal malfunction in any infant who survives acute NEC ; this 
complication may develop as late as 3 months postoperatively.  
Crohn's disease  
Clinical effects may be mild and nonspecific initially; they vary according to the location and extent 
"of the lesion. Acute inflammatory signs and symptoms mimic appen dicitis and include steady, colicky "
"pain in the right lower quadrant, cramping, tenderness, flatulence, nausea, fever, and diarrhea. "
"Bleeding may occur and, although usually mild, may be massive. Bloody stools may also occur. "
"Chronic symptoms, which are mo re typical of the disease, are more persistent and less severe; they "
"include diarrhea (four to six stools per day) with pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant, "
"steatorrhea (excess fat in feces), marked weight loss and, rarely, clubbing of fingers. The patient may "
"complain of weakness and fatigue. Complications include intestinal obstruction, fistula formation "
"between the small bowel and the bladder, perianal and perirectal abscesses and fistulas, intra -"
"abdominal abscesses, and perforation.  "
Pseudomembr anous enterocolitis  
Pseudomembranous enterocolitis begins suddenly with copious watery or bloody diarrhea that may 
"contain pus or mucus, abdominal pain, and fever. Serious complications, including severe "
"dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, s hock, and colonic perforation, may occur in this "
disorder.  
Irritable bowel syndrome  
IBS characteristically produces lower abdominal pain (usually relieved by defecation or passage of 
gas) and diarrhea that typically occurs during the day. These symptoms alternate with constipation 
or normal bowel function. Stools are commonly small and contain visible mucus. Dyspepsia and 
abdominal distention may occur. Symptoms of IBS are two to three times more common in women 
"than in men, with w omen comprising 80% of patients with a more severe form of the disorder.  "
Celiac disease  
Celiac disease produces clinical effects on many body systems: GI symptoms include recurrent 
"attacks of diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal distention due to flatulenc e, stomach cramps, weakness, "
"anorexia and, occasionally, increased appetite without weight gain. Atrophy of intestinal villi leads to "
"malabsorption of fat, carbohydrates, and protein as well as loss of calories, fat -soluble vitamins (A, "
"D, and K), calcium,  and essential minerals and electrolytes. In adults, celiac disease produces "
"multiple nonspecific ulcers in the small bowel, which may perforate or bleed. Hematologic effects "
"include normochromic, hypochromic, or macrocytic anemia due to poor absorption of  folate, iron, "
"and vitamin B12 and to hypoprothrombinemia from jejunal loss of vitamin K. Osteomalacia, "
"osteoporosis, tetany, and bone pain (especially in the lower back, rib cage, and pelvis) are some of "
the musculoskeletal symptoms of celiac disease. The se signs and symptoms are due to calcium loss 
"and vitamin D deficiency, which weakens the skeleton, causing rickets in children and compression "
"fractures in adults. Neurologic effects may include peripheral neuropathy, seizures, or paresthesia. "
"Dry skin, e czema, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, and acne rosacea are some of the dermatologic "
"effects of celiac disease. Deficiency of sulfur -containing amino acids may cause generalized fine, "
"sparse, prematurely gray hair; brittle nails; and localized hyperpi gmentation on the face, lips, or "
"mucosa. Endocrine symptoms include amenorrhea, hypometabolism and, possibly, with severe "
"malabsorption, adrenocortical insufficiency. Psychosocial effects include mood changes and "
"irritability. Symptoms may develop during t he first year of life, when gluten is introduced into the "
child's diet as cereal. Clinical effects may disappear during adolescence and reappear in adulthood. 
One theory proposes that the age at which symptoms first appear depends on the strength of the 
"genetic factor: A strong factor produces symptoms during the child's first 4 years; a weak factor, in "
late childhood or adulthood.  
Diverticular disease  
"Diverticulosis usually produces no symptoms but may cause recurrent left lower quadrant pain, "
which is  commonly accompanied by alternating constipation and diarrhea and is relieved by 
defecation or the passage of flatus. Symptoms resemble irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and suggest 
"that both disorders may coexist. Mild diverticulitis produces moderate left lower abdominal pain, "
"mild nausea, gas, irregular bowel habits, low -grade fever, and leukocytosis. In severe diverticulitis, "
"the diverticula can rupture and produce abscesses or peritonitis, which occurs in up to 20% of such "
patients. Symptoms of rupture i nclude abdominal rigidity and left lower quadrant pain. Peritonitis 
follows release of fecal material from the rupture site and causes signs of sepsis and shock (high 
"fever, chills, and hypotension). Rupture of the diverticulum near a vessel may cause micr oscopic or "
"massive hemorrhage, depending on the vessel's size. Chronic diverticulitis may cause fibrosis and "
adhesions that narrow the bowel's lumen and lead to bowel obstruction. Symptoms of incomplete 
"obstruction are constipation, ribbonlike stools, inte rmittent diarrhea, and abdominal distention. "
"Increasing obstruction causes abdominal rigidity and pain, diminishing or absent bowel sounds, "
"nausea, and vomiting.  "
Appendicitis  
"Typically, appendicitis begins with generalized or localized abdominal pain i n the right upper "
"abdomen, followed by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting (rarely profuse). Pain eventually localizes in "
"the right lower abdomen (McBurney's point) with abdominal “boardlike” rigidity, retractive "
"respirations, increasing tenderness, increasingl y severe abdominal spasms and, almost invariably, "
rebound tenderness. (Rebound tenderness on the opposite side of the abdomen suggests peritoneal 
"inflammation.) Later signs and symptoms include constipation or diarrhea, slight fever, and "
tachycardia. The p atient may walk bent over or lie with his right knee flexed to reduce pain.  
Peritonitis  
"The key symptom of peritonitis is sudden, severe, and diffuse abdominal pain that tends to intensify "
"and localize in the area of the underlying disorder. For instan ce, if appendicitis causes the rupture, "
"pain eventually localizes in the right lower quadrant. Many patients display weakness, pallor, "
"excessive sweating, and cold skin as a result of excessive loss of fluid, electrolytes, and protein into "
the abdominal ca vity. Decreased intestinal motility and paralytic ileus result from the effect of 
"bacterial toxins on the intestinal muscles. Intestinal obstruction causes nausea, vomiting, and "
"abdominal rigidity. Other clinical characteristics include hypotension, tachyc ardia, signs and "
"symptoms of dehydration (oliguria, thirst, dry swollen tongue, and P pinched skin), an acutely tender "
"abdomen associated with rebound tenderness, temperature of 103° F (39.4° C) or higher, and "
hypokalemia. Inflammation of the diaphragmatic  peritoneum may cause shoulder pain and hiccups. 
Abdominal distention and resulting upward displacement of the diaphragm may decrease 
"respiratory capacity. Typically, the patient with peritonitis tends to breathe shallowly and move as "
"little as possible to  minimize pain. He may lie on his back, with his knees flexed, to relax abdominal "
muscles.  
Intestinal obstruction  
"Colicky pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention characterize small -bowel "
"obstruction. It may also cause drowsiness,  intense thirst, malaise, and aching and may dry up oral "
"mucous membranes and the tongue. Auscultation reveals bowel sounds, borborygmi, and rushes; "
"occasionally, these are loud enough to be heard without a stethoscope. Palpation elicits abdominal "
"tenderne ss, with moderate distention; rebound tenderness occurs when obstruction has caused "
"strangulation with ischemia. In late stages, signs of hypovolemic shock result from progressive "
dehydration and plasma loss.  
Inguinal hernia  
Inguinal hernia usually cau ses a lump to appear over the herniated area when the patient stands or 
strains. The lump disappears when the patient is supine. Tension on the herniated contents may 
"cause a sharp, steady pain in the groin, which fades when the hernia is reduced. Strangul ation "
produces severe pain and may lead to partial or complete bowel obstruction and even intestinal 
"necrosis. Partial bowel obstruction may cause anorexia, vomiting, pain and tenderness in the groin, "
"an irreducible mass, and diminished bowel sounds. Compl ete obstruction may cause shock, high "
"fever, absent bowel sounds, and bloody stools.  "
Intussusception  
"In an infant or child, intussusception produces four cardinal clinical effects: Intermittent attacks of "
"colicky pain cause the child to scream, draw his legs up to his abdomen, turn pale and diaphoretic "
"and, possibly, display grunting respirations. Vomiting of stomach contents may occur initially, "
"followed by further vomiting of bilestained or fecal material. “Currant -jelly” stools, contai ning a "
"mixture of blood and mucus, may be observed. The patient will have a tender, distended abdomen, "
"with a palpable, sausage -shaped abdominal mass; the viscera are usually absent from the right lower "
"quadrant. In adults, intussusception produces nonspec ific, chronic, and intermittent symptoms, "
"including colicky abdominal pain and tenderness, vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally constipation), "
"bloody stools, and weight loss. Abdominal pain usually localizes in the right lower quadrant, radiates "
"to the back, a nd increases with eating. Adults with severe intussusception may develop "
"strangulation with excruciating pain, abdominal distention, and tachycardia.  "
Volvulus  
"Vomiting and rapid, marked abdominal distention follow sudden onset of severe abdominal pain.  "
"Nausea, vomiting, bloody stools, constipation, and shock may occur. Without immediate treatment, "
"volvulus can lead to strangulation of the twisted bowel loop, ischemia, infarction, perforation, and "
fatal peritonitis.  
 
 
Inactive colon  
The primary symptom  of inactive colon is chronic constipation. The patient commonly strains to 
"produce hard, dry stools accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. Straining can aggravate other "
rectal conditions such as hemorrhoids.  
Pancreatitis  
"In many patients, the first  and only symptom of mild pancreatitis is steady epigastric pain centered "
"close to the umbilicus, radiating between the tenth thoracic and sixth lumbar vertebrae, and "
"unrelieved by vomiting. However, a severe attack causes extreme pain, persistent vomiting , "
"abdominal rigidity, diminished bowel activity (suggesting peritonitis), crackles at lung bases, and left "
"pleural effusion. Progression produces extreme malaise and restlessness, with mottled skin, "
"tachycardia, low -grade fever (100° to 102° F [37.7° to 38 .8° C]), and cold, sweaty extremities. The "
proximity of the inflamed pancreas to the bowel may cause ileus. If pancreatitis damages the islets 
"of Langerhans, complications may include diabetes mellitus. Fulminant pancreatitis causes massive "
"hemorrhage and total destruction of the pancreas, resulting in diabetic acidosis, shock, or coma.  "
Hemorrhoids  
"Although hemorrhoids may be asymptomatic, they characteristically cause painless, intermittent "
"bleeding, which occurs on defecation. Bright red blood appears  on stool or on toilet paper due to "
injury of the fragile mucosa covering the hemorrhoid. These first -degree hemorrhoids may itch 
"because of poor anal hygiene. When second -degree hemorrhoids prolapse, they're usually painless "
and spontaneously return to th e anal canal following defecation. Third -degree hemorrhoids cause 
constant discomfort and prolapse in response to any increase in intraabdominal pressure. They 
must be manually reduced. Thrombosis of external hemorrhoids produces sudden rectal pain and a 
"subcutaneous, large, firm lump that the patient can feel. If hemorrhoids cause severe or recurrent "
"bleeding, they may lead to secondary anemia with significant pallor, fatigue, and weakness; "
"however, such systemic complications are rare.  "
Anorectal absces s and fistula  
"Characteristics are throbbing pain and tenderness at the site of the abscess. A hard, painful lump "
"develops on one side, preventing comfortable sitting. Discharge of pus may occur from the rectum, "
and there may be constipation or pain assoc iated with bowel movements.  
Rectal polyps  
"Because rectal polyps don't generally cause symptoms, they're usually discovered incidentally during "
a digital examination or rectosigmoidoscopy. Rectal bleeding is a common sign; high rectal polyps 
"leave a str eak of blood on the stool, whereas low rectal polyps bleed freely. Rectal polyps vary in "
"appearance. Common polypoid adenomas are small, multiple lesions that are redder than normal "
"mucosa. They're commonly pedunculated (attached to rectal mucosa by a long , thin stalk) and "
"granular, with a red, lobular, or eroded surface. Villous adenomas are usually sessile (attached to the "
"mucosa by a wide base) and vary in size from 0.5 to 12 cm. They are soft, friable, and finely "
"lobulated. They may grow large and cause  painful defecation; however, because adenomas are soft, "
"they rarely cause bowel obstruction. Sometimes adenomas prolapse outside the anus, expelling "
"parts of the adenoma with feces. These polyps may cause diarrhea, bloody stools, and subsequent "
"fluid and electrolyte depletion, with hypotension and oliguria. In hereditary polyposis, rectal polyps "
resemble benign adenomas but occur as hundreds of small (0.5 cm) lesions carpeting the entire 
"mucosal surface. Associated signs include diarrhea, bloody stools, an d secondary anemia. In patients "
"with hereditary polyposis, changes in bowel habits with abdominal pain usually signal rectosigmoid "
"cancer. P Juvenile polyps are large, inflammatory lesions, commonly without an epithelial covering. "
Mucus -filled cysts cover their usually smooth surface. Focal polypoid hyperplasia produces small 
"(less than 3 mm), granular, sessile lesions, similar to the colon in color, or gray or translucent. They "
usually occur at the rectosigmoid junction.  
Pilonidal disease  
"Generally, a pilonidal cyst produces no symptoms until it becomes infected, causing local pain, "
"tenderness, swelling, or heat. Other clinical features include continuous or intermittent purulent "
"drainage, followed by development of an abscess, chills, feve r, headache, and malaise.  "
Rectal prolapse  
"In rectal prolapse, protrusion of tissue from the rectum may occur during defecation or walking. "
"Other symptoms include a persistent sensation of rectal fullness, bloody diarrhea, pain in the lower "
"abdomen due to ulceration, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and rectal incontinence. "
Hemorrhoids or rectal polyps may coexist with a prolapse.  
Anal fissure  
"Onset of an acu te anal fissure is characterized by tearing, cutting, or burning pain during or "
immediately after a bowel movement. A few drops of blood may streak toilet paper or underclothes. 
Painful anal sphincter spasms result from ulceration of a “sentinel pile” (swe lling at the lower end of 
the fissure). A fissure may heal spontaneously and completely or it may partially heal and break 
open again. Chronic fissure produces scar tissue that hampers normal bowel evacuation.  
Pruritus ani  
"The key symptom of pruritus a ni is perianal itching or burning after a bowel movement, during "
"stress, or at night. In acute pruritus ani, scratching produces reddened skin, with weeping "
"excoriations; in chronic pruritus ani, skin becomes thick and leathery, with excessive pigmentation . "
Proctitis  
"Key symptoms include tenesmus, constipation, a feeling of rectal fullness, and abdominal cramps on "
"the left side. The patient feels an intense urge to defecate, which produces a small amount of stool "
that may contain blood and mucus.  
 
Neurofibromatosis  
Signs and symptoms of NF-1 vary greatly from one family to another and within members of t he same 
family. A patient who initially seems to have mild symptoms may develop more severe pro blems later. 
"An infant with this form may present with only café- au-lait spots or may also have congenital glaucoma, "
"plexiform neurofibromas, or pseudoarthrosis. About 90% of patients have Lisch nodules on the  iris; as "
"many as 15% develop optic pathway gliomas, which may cause a significant loss of vision. Cu taneous and "
other neurofibromas may begin to develop or become more prominent at puberty; pregnancy may 
exacerbate tumor growth. Some tumors become malignant; about 8% of patients develop 
neurofibrosarcoma (cancer of the nerve sheath). Other less-specific features may include other types of 
"tumors (such as meningiomas), short stature, seizures, speech and learning disabilities, mental "
"retardation (occasionally), and abnormalities of the cerebral, GI, and renal arteries. The first sign of NF- 2 "
"is usually a central nervous system tumor, such as a spinal or intracranial meningioma, an acoustic "
"neuroma, and occasionally a schwannoma or spinal astrocytoma. Cutaneous neurofibromas may be less "
"conspicuous in this form, and café- au-lait spots may be minimal or even absent. Learning disabilities and "
other less-specific features characteristic of NF-1 aren't typically seen in NF-2.  
Osteogenesis imperfecta  
"Clinical severity varies, depending on the type. In type I, fractures characteristically occur from min imal "
"trauma. The sclerae are a deep blue-black color, and the teeth may be yellow or even grayish blue from "
"opalescent dentin. Patients with dental abnormalities are shorter and have more fractures at birth, more "
"frequent fractures, and more severe skeletal deformities than type I patients with normal teeth. Bowing "
"of the lower limbs is common in this type, as is kyphosis in adults. About 40% of all adu lts with type I "
"have severely impaired hearing, and virtually all adults have some degree of hearing impairment by age "
50. The number of fractures may spontaneously decrease in adolescence. 
"Type II is characterized by intrauterine fractures due to extreme bone fragility, leading to intrauteri ne or "
"early infant death. Death usually results from complications of bone fragility, heart failure, pu lmonary "
"hypertension, or respiratory failure. Therapeutic intervention doesn't usually increase survival. Type III is "
generally nonlethal. Fractures are usually present at birth and occur frequently in childhood; they 
"typically lead to progressive skeletal deformity and, eventually, impaired mobility. Pati ents have a poor "
growth rate; most fall below the third percentile in height for their age. Their sclerae are usually normal  
"or light blue, and their teeth aren't usually opalescent. Type IV is characterized by osteoporosis, which "
leads to increased bone fragility. The sclerae may be light blue at birth but appear normal in adolescents 
"and adults. Bowed limbs may be present at birth, but only 25% of patients have fractures at birth. The "
"number of fractures may decrease spontaneously at puberty, but the majority of patients are short. A "
few have a skull deformity.  
Marfan syndrome  
"The most common signs and symptoms of this disorder are skeletal abnormalities, particularly "
excessively long tubular bones and an arm span that exceeds the patient's height. The patient is usually  
"taller than average for his family (in the 95th percentile for his age), with the upper half of his body "
"shorter than average and the lower half, longer. His fingers are long and slender (arachnodactyly). "
"Weakness of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules results in joints that are loose, hyperextensible, an d "
habitually dislocated. Excessive growth of the rib bones gives rise to chest deformities such as pectus 
excavatum (funnel chest). Eye problems are also common; 75% of patients have crystallin e lens 
"displacement (ectopia lentis), the ocular hallmark of Marfan syndrome. Quivering of the iris with eye "
"movement (iridodonesis) typically suggests this disorder. Most patients are severely myopic, m any have "
"retinal detachment, and some have glaucoma. The most serious complications occur in the "
"cardiovascular system and include weakness of the aortic media, which leads to progressive dilation o r "
dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Such dilation appears first in the coronary sinuses and i s 
commonly preceded by aortic insufficiency. Less-common cardiovascular complications inclu de mitral 
"valve prolapse and endocarditis. Other associated problems include sparsity of subcutaneous fat, "
"frequent hernias, cystic lung disease, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and scoliosis or kyphosis.  "
Stickler's syndrome  
"The clinical phenotype can consist of ocular, auditory, craniofacial, and skeletal abnormaliti es. The "
number of organ systems involved and the specific phenotypic features expressed can vary si gnificantly 
"between affected family members and, in particular, between unrelated affected persons. Ocular "
"symptoms, particularly high myopia, are common in persons with Stickler's syndrome, with the "
exception of those who have COLIJA2 mutations. Vitreal abnormalities are considered a hallmark of 
"Stickler's syndrome, although the abnormalities in the vitreous differ in persons with a C OL2AI mutation "
from those with a COLIIAI mutation. Retinal detachment resulting in blindness is the most serio us ocular 
complication. The vitreoretinal degeneration that leads to retinal detachment is much more comm on in 
persons with a COL2AI mutation. Persons with Stickler's syndrome can also have congenital cataracts an d 
develop glaucoma. Ocular symptoms are typically absent in persons with linkage to COLIJA2. Auditory  
symptoms include conductive hearing loss secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunctio n in children with 
cleft palate or collagen defects in the inner ear apparatus. Sensorineural hearing loss has an earlier onset 
and tends to be more progressive in persons with a COLIJAI mutation. Craniofacial features may include 
micrognathia (small lower jaw) and a flattened midface and nasal bridge. Micrognathia may be 
associated with some degree of cleft palate (bifid uvula to complete cleft of the palate). Mi crognathia 
associated with glossoptosis places neonates and infants with Stickler's syndrome at significant risk  for 
episodic obstructive apnea during feeding and when lying flat. Skeletal symptoms can include jo int 
"hypermobility in young children, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and, later, degenerative arth ropathy "
"during early adult years. Also related to the collagen defect, scoliosis and mitral valve prolapse c an "
develop in some persons with Stickler's syndrome. 
Cystic fibrosis  
The clinical effects of cystic fibrosis may become apparent soon after birth or may take years to  develop. 
"They include major aberrations in sweat gland, respiratory, and GI function. Sweat gland dysfunction is "
the most consistent abnormality. Increased concentrations of sodium and chloride in the sweat lead to 
"hyponatremia and hypochloremia and can eventually induce fatal shock and arrhythmias, especially in "
"hot weather. Respiratory symptoms reflect obstructive changes in the lungs: wheezy respirations;  a dry, "
"nonproductive paroxysmal cough; dyspnea; and tachypnea. These changes stem from thick , tenacious "
secretions in the bronchioles and alveoli and eventually lead to severe atelectasis and emphysema. 
"Children with cystic fibrosis display a barrel chest, cyanosis, and clubbing of the fingers and  toes. They "
suffer recurring bronchitis and pneumonia as well as associated nasal polyps and sinusitis. Death 
"typically results from pneumonia, emphysema, or atelectasis. The GI effects of cystic fibrosis occur "
"mainly in the intestines, pancreas, and liver. One early symptom is meconium ileus; the neonate  with "
"cystic fibrosis doesn't excrete meconium, a dark green mucilaginous material found in the i ntestine at "
"birth. He develops symptoms of intestinal obstruction, such as abdominal distention, vomiting, "
"constipation, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. As the child gets older, obstruction of the "
"pancreatic ducts and resulting deficiency of trypsin, amylase, and lipase prevent the conversion and  "
"absorption of fat and protein in the GI tract. The undigested food is then excreted in frequent, bulky, "
"foul-smelling, pale stools with a high fat content. This malabsorption induces po or weight gain, poor "
"growth, ravenous appetite, distended abdomen, thin extremities, and sallow skin with poor turgor. The "
"inability to absorb fats results in a deficiency of fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), leading to clo tting "
"problems, retarded bone growth, and delayed sexual development. Males may experience azoospermia "
and sterility; females may experience secondary amenorrhea but can reproduce. A commo n 
complication in infants and children is rectal prolapse secondary to malnutrition and wasti ng of 
"perirectal supporting tissues. In the pancreas, fibrotic tissue, multiple cysts, thick mucus, and ev entually "
"fat replace the acini (small, saclike swellings normally found in this gland), producing sym ptoms of "
"pancreatic insufficiency: insufficient insulin production, abnormal glucose tolerance, and glyco suria. "
"About 15% of patients have adequate pancreatic exocrine function for normal digestion and, therefore, "
"have a better prognosis. Biliary obstruction and fibrosis may prolong neonatal jaundice. In some patients , "
"cirrhosis and portal hypertension may lead to esophageal varices, episodes of hematemesis and, "
"occasionally, hepatomegaly. "
Tay-Sachs disease  
"A neonate with classic Tay-Sachs disease appears normal at birth, although he may have an exaggerated "
"Moro reflex. By age 3 to 6 months, he becomes apathetic and responds only to loud sounds. His n eck, "
"trunk, arm, and leg muscles grow weaker, and soon he can't sit up or lift his head. He has difficulty "
"turning over, can't grasp objects, and has progressive vision loss. By age 18 months, the infant is usu ally "
"deaf and blind and has seizures, generalized paralysis, and spasticity. His pupils are dilated and don't "
react to light. Decerebrate rigidity and a vegetative state follow. The child suffers recurrent 
bronchopneumonia after age 2 and usually dies before age 5. A child who survives may develop  ataxia 
and progressive motor retardation between ages 2 and 8. The “ juvenile ” form of Tay-Sachs disease 
generally appears between ages 2 and 5 as a progressive deterioration of psychomotor skills and gait. 
Patients with this type can survive to adulthood.  
Phenylketonuria  
An infant with undiagnosed and untreated PKU appears normal at birth but by 4 months begins to show 
"signs of arrested brain development, including mental retardation and, later, personality disturbances "
(schizoid and antisocial personality patterns and uncontrollable temper). Such a child may have a lighter 
complexion than unaffected siblings and typically has blue eyes. He may also have microcephaly; 
"eczematous skin lesions or dry, rough skin; and a musty (mousy) odor due to skin an d urinary excretion "
"of phenylacetic acid. About 80% of these children have abnormal EEG patterns, and about one-third hav e "
"seizures, usually beginning between ages 6 and 12 months. Children with PKU show a precipitous "
"decrease in IQ in their first year, are usually hyperactive and irritable, and exhibit purposeless, repetitiv e "
motions. They have increased muscle tone and an awkward gait. Although blood phenylalanine level s are 
"near normal at birth, they begin to rise within a few days. By the time they reach significant lev els (about "
"30 mg/dl), cerebral damage has begun. Such irreversible damage probably is complete by age 2 or 3 . "
"However, early detection and treatment can minimize cerebral damage, and children under strict dietary "
control can lead normal lives. 
Albinism  
Light-skinned Whites with tyrosinase-negative albinism have pale skin and hair color rangi ng from white 
to yellow; their pupils appear red because of translucent irides. Blacks with the same disorder have h air 
"that may be white, faintly tinged with yellow, or yellow-brown. Both Whites and Blacks with "
"tyrosinase-positive albinism grow darker as they age. For instance, their hair may become straw- colored "
or light brown and their skin cream-colored or pink. People with tyrosinase-positive alb inism may also 
"have freckles and pigmented nevi that may require excision. In tyrosinase-variable albinism , at birth the "
"child's hair is white, his skin is pink, and his eyes are gray. As he grows older, though, his hair becomes "
"yellow, his irides may become darker, and his skin may even tan slightly. The skin of a person w ith "
albinism is easily damaged by the sun. It may look weather-beaten and is highly susceptible t o 
"precancerous and cancerous growths. The patient may also have photophobia, myopia, strabismus, and "
congenital horizontal nystagmus.  
Sickle cell anemia  
"Characteristically, sickle cell anemia produces tachycardia, cardiomegaly, systolic and diastolic mu rmurs, "
"pulmonary infarctions (which may result in cor pulmonale), chronic fatigue, unexplained dyspnea or "
"dyspnea on exertion, hepatomegaly, jaundice, pallor, joint swelling, aching bones, chest pains, i schemic "
"leg ulcers (especially around the ankles), and increased susceptibility to infection. Such symptoms usual ly "
don't develop until after age 6 months because large amounts of fetal Hb protect infants for the fi rst few 
"months after birth. Low socioeconomic status and related problems, such as poor nutrition and "
"education, may delay diagnosis and supportive treatment. Infection, stress, dehydration, and conditio ns "
"that provoke hypoxia — strenuous exercise, high altitude, unpressurized aircraft, cold, and "
"vasoconstrictive drugs —may all provoke periodic crises. A painful crisis (vasoocclusive crisis, infarctive "
"crisis), the most common crisis and the hallmark of the disease, usually appears periodically  after age 5. "
"It results from blood vessel obstruction by rigid, tangled sickle cells, which causes tissue anoxia and "
"possible necrosis. This type of crisis is characterized by severe abdominal, thoracic, muscular, or bone "
"pain and possibly worsening jaundice, dark urine, and a low-grade fever. Autosplenectomy, in which "
"splenic damage and scarring is so extensive that the spleen shrinks and becomes impalpable, occurs i n "
patients with longterm disease. This can lead to increased susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae 
"sepsis, which can be fatal without prompt treatment. "
"Infection may develop after the crisis subsides (in 4 days to several weeks), so watch for lethargy, "
"sleepiness, fever, or apathy. An aplastic crisis (megaloblastic crisis) results from bone marrow depression "
"and is associated with infection, usually viral. It's characterized by pallor, lethargy, sleepiness, dyspnea, "
"possible coma, markedly decreased bone marrow activity, and RBC hemolysis. In infants between  ages 8 "
"months and 2 years, an acute sequestration crisis may cause sudden massive entrapment of RBCs in the "
"spleen and liver. This rare crisis causes lethargy and pallor and, if untreated, commonly progresses to "
hypovolemic shock and death. A hemolytic crisis is quite rare and usually occurs in patients who also 
have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. It probably results from complications of sic kle cell 
"anemia, such as infection, rather than from the disorder itself. Hemolytic crisis causes liver cong estion "
"and hepatomegaly as a result of degenerative changes. It worsens chronic jaundice, although increased "
jaundice doesn't always point to a hemolytic crisis. Suspect any of these crises in a sickle cell  anemia 
"patient with pale lips, tongue, palms, or nail beds; lethargy; listlessness; sleepiness with difficul ty "
awakening; irritability; severe pain; a fever over 104° F (40° C); or a fever of 100° F (37 .8° C) that persists 
"for 2 days. Sickle cell anemia also causes long-term complications. Typically, the child is small for his age "
"and has delayed puberty. (However, fertility isn't impaired.) If he reaches adulthood, his body build t ends "
"to be spiderlike — narrow shoulders and hips, long extremities, curved spine, barrel chest, and elongated "
"skull. An adult usually has complications from organ infarction, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. "
Premature death commonly results from infection or from repeated occlusion of small bloo d vessels and 
consequent infarction or necrosis of major organs (such as cerebral blood vessel occlusion causing 
stroke).  
Hemophilia  
"Hemophilia produces abnormal bleeding, which may be mild, moderate, or severe, depend ing on the "
degree of factor deficiency. Mild hemophilia commonly goes undiagnosed until adulthood  because the 
patient doesn't bleed spontaneously or after minor trauma but has prolonged bleeding if challenged by 
"major trauma or surgery. Postoperative bleeding continues as a slow ooze or ceases and starts ag ain, up "
"to 8 days after surgery. Severe hemophilia causes spontaneous bleeding. In many cases, the first sign of "
"severe hemophilia is excessive bleeding after circumcision. Later, spontaneous bleeding or sev ere "
bleeding after minor trauma may produce large subcutaneous and deep intramuscular hematomas. 
"Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis) and muscles causes pain, swelling, extreme tenderness and, possibly, "
permanent deformity. Moderate hemophilia causes symptoms similar to severe hemophilia  but 
produces only occasional spontaneous bleeding episodes. Bleeding near peripheral nerves may cause 
"peripheral neuropathy, pain, paresthesia, and muscle atrophy. If bleeding impairs blood flow through a "
"major vessel, it can cause ischemia and gangrene. Pharyngeal, lingual, intracardial, intracerebral, and "
intracranial bleeding may all lead to shock and death.  
Fragile X syndrome  
Small children may have relatively few identifiable physical characteristics; behavioral or learning 
difficulties may be the initial presenting features. Many adult male patients display a prominent j aw and 
"forehead and a head circumference exceeding the 90th percentile. A long, narrow face with long or large "
ears that may be posteriorly rotated can be a helpful finding at all ages. Connective tissue 
"abnormalities —including hyperextension of the fingers, a floppy mitral valve (in 80% of adults), and m ild "
"to severe pectus excavatum —have also been reported. Unusually large testes, found in most affected "
"males after puberty, are an important identifying factor of the disorder. The average IQ of a person with "
"fragile X syndrome is comparable to that of a person with Down syndrome; however, the beha vioral "
"characteristics are quite different. Hyperactivity, speech difficulties, language delay, and autistic-like "
"behaviors may be attributed to other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and thus "
"delay the diagnosis. About 50% of females with the FMR1 full mutation will have clini cal symptoms, "
although the degree of severity and number of symptoms vary widely among females wi th fragile X 
syndrome. Those who are symptomatic typically have a much milder clinical presentation t han males 
due to having an unaffected X chromosome in addition to the one with an FMR1 full mutation. So me 
degree of cognitive impairment is usually present in symptomatic females. Learning disabil ities —math 
"difficulties, language deficits, and attentional problems —are most common. Some females can have IQ "
"scores in the mental retardation range. Although affected females can have autistic-like features, "
excessive shyness or social anxiety are the more common behavioral symptoms. Prominent ears and the  
connective tissue manifestations may be as significant as in males. Although males with the F MR1 
"permutation are asymptomatic, some female carriers of an FMR1 premutation can have associated "
symptoms. These symptoms include significantly earlier menopause and a low normal perform ance IQ.  
Down syndrome 
The physical signs of Down syndrome (especially hypotonia) as well as some dysmorphic faci al features 
and heart defects may be apparent at birth. The degree of mental retardation may not become apparent 
"until the infant grows older. People with Down syndrome typically have craniofacial  anomalies, such as "
"slanting, almond-shaped eyes with epicanthic folds; a flat face; a protruding tongue; a small m outh and "
chin; a single transverse palmar crease (simian crease); small white spots (Brushfield's spots) on t he iris; 
"strabismus; a small skull; a flat bridge across the nose; slow dental development, with abnorm al or "
"absent teeth; small ears; a short neck; and cataracts. Other physical effects may include dry, sensitive "
"skin with decreased elasticity; umbilical hernia; short stature; short extremities, with broad, flat, and "
squarish hands and feet; clinodactyly (small little finger that curves inward); a wide space between the 
first and second toe; and abnormal fingerprints and footprints. Hypotonic limb muscles i mpair reflex 
"development, posture, coordination, and balance. Congenital heart disease (septal defects or pulmonary "
"or aortic stenosis), duodenal atresia, megacolon, and pelvic bone abnormalities are common. The "
incidence of leukemia and thyroid disorders (particularly hypothyroidism) may be increased. Frequent 
upper respiratory infections can be a serious problem. Genitalia may be poorly developed and  puberty 
delayed. Females may menstruate and be fertile. Males are infertile with low serum testosterone levels;  
many have undescended testicles. Patients with Down syndrome may have an IQ between 30 and 7 0; 
"however, social performance is usually beyond that expected for mental age and fewer than 10% wil l "
have severe mental retardation. The level of intellectual function depends greatly on the environment 
and the amount of early stimulation received in addition to the IQ.  
Trisomy 18 syndrome  
Growth retardation begins in utero and remains significant after birth. Initial hypotonia may soon give 
"way to hypertonia. Common findings include microcephaly and dolichocephaly, micrognathia, gen ital "
"and perineal abnormalities (including imperforate anus), diaphragmatic hernia, and various renal  "
"defects. Congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of "
"the great vessels, and coarctation of the aorta, occur in 80% to 90% of patients and may be the cause of "
death in many infants. Other findings may include a short and narrow nose with upturned nares; 
"unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate; low-set, slightly pointed ears; a short neck; a c onspicuous "
clenched hand with overlapping fingers (usually seen on ultrasound as well); neural tube defects;  
omphalocele; cystic hygroma; choroid plexus cysts (also seen in some healthy infants); and 
oligohydramnios.  
Trisomy 13 syndrome  
"Infants with trisomy 13 syndrome may present with microcephaly, varying degrees of "
"holoprosencephaly, sloping forehead with wide sutures and fontanel, and a scalp defect at the vertex. "
"Microophthalmia, cataracts, and other eye abnormalities are seen in most patients with full trisomy  13. "
Bilateral cleft lip with associated cleft palate is seen in at least 45% of patients. Most are born wi th a 
"congenital heart defect, especially hypoplastic left heart, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus "
"arteriosus, or dextroposition, which may significantly contribute significantly to the cause of death. "
"Other possible findings include a flat and broad nose, low-set ears and inner ear abnormalities, "
"polydactyly of the hands and feet, club feet, omphaloceles, neural tube defects, cystic hygro ma, genital "
"abnormalities, cystic kidneys, hydronephrosis, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Affected infants m ay "
"also experience failure to thrive, seizures, apnea, and feeding difficulties.  "
Turner's syndrome  
"Turner's syndrome produces obvious characteristic signs. At birth, 50% of infants with this syndro me "
"measure below the third percentile in length. Commonly, they have swollen hands and feet, a wide "
"chest, and a low hairline that becomes more obvious as they grow. They may have severe we bbing of the "
"neck, and some have coarse, enlarged, prominent ears. Gonadal dysgenesis is seen at birth. Other signs "
"and symptoms include pigmented nevi, lymphedema, hypoplasia, or malformed nails. As the child grows, "
short stature is common. The patient may exhibit average to slightly below-average inte lligence. 
Developmental problems include right-left disorientation for extrapersonal space an d defective figure 
drawing. The patient is typically immature and socially naive. Auscultation of the infant's chest indicates 
"cardiovascular malformations, such as coarctation of the aorta and ventricular septal defects.  "
Klinefelter's syndrome  
Klinefelter's syndrome may not be apparent until puberty or later in mild cases. Because many of th ese 
"patients aren't mentally retarded, behavioral problems in adolescence or infertility may be the only "
presenting features initially. The syndrome's characteristic features include a small penis and prostate 
"gland, small testicles, sparse facial and abdominal hair, feminine distribution of pubic hair (tri angular "
"shape), sexual dysfunction (impotence, lack of libido) and, in fewer than 50% of patients, gyneco mastia. "
Aspermatogenesis and infertility result from progressive sclerosis and hyalinization of the sem iniferous 
tubules in the testicles and from testicular fibrosis during and after puberty. In the mosaic form of 
"Klinefelter's syndrome, such pathologic changes and resulting infertility may be delayed. Kl inefelter's "
"syndrome may also be associated with osteoporosis, abnormal body build (long legs with short, obese "
"trunk), tall stature, learning disabilities characterized by poor verbal skills and, in some individu als, "
behavioral problems beginning in adolescence. It's also associated with an increased incidence of 
pulmonary disease and varicose veins and a significantly increased rate of breast cancer because of the 
extra X chromosome.  
Velocardiofacial syndrome  
Clinical features of VCFS vary greatly among affected persons. Neonates with complex heart 
"malformations, dysmorphic features, hypocalcemia, missing thymus, and renal anomali es represent the "
"severe end of the VCFS clinical presentation. On the other hand, the clinical features can be so mild that "
an affected parent isn't identified until an offspring is diagnosed and genetic testing is subsequently 
"done on the parents. Symptoms have been reported in the cardiac, craniofacial, neuropsychologi cal, "
"renal, ocular, neurologic, skeletal, endocrine, immune, and hematologic systems. The most com mon "
"symptoms can be classified as cardiac, craniofacial, and neuropsychological. Clinical studies indicate that "
"70% to 85% of persons with VCFS have cardiac anomalies, of which conotruncal defects (for example, "
"tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosis) are the most common. This incidence may "
"decrease over time as persons with only mild symptoms, such as learning difficulties in school  or subtle "
"dysmorphic features, are tested and found to be deletion positive. Craniofacial features include pala tal "
"abnormalities, dysmorphic facial features, and dysphagia usually due to velopharyngeal  incompetence "
"with or without pharyngoesophageal dysmotility. Therefore, feeding problems during infancy are "
common. The palate may be hypotonic and hypoplastic or have a midline cleft (rangi ng from bifid uvula 
to complete clefts of the palate). Related to palate problems are speech delays and 
abnormalities —particularly hypernasal speech and dyspraxia. Typical dysmorphic features include 
"malformed ears, narrow palpebral fissures, hooded upper eyelids, ptosis, a broad square nasal root, a "
"bulbous nasal tip (typically with a midline vertical crease), and micrognathia. Neuropsycholo gical "
symptoms are present to some degree in most persons with VCFS. Hypotonia during the neona tal stage 
through early childhood period has been reported in more than 75% of cases. Even as hypotonia resolves  
"with maturation, coordination and balance remain problematic. Cognitive symptoms, which can range "
"from learning difficulties to varying levels of mental retardation, have been reported in over 8 0% of "
"persons with VCFS. Children with VCFS typically have difficulties in visual-spatial activities, p lanning, "
"attention, and concentration. Their strengths tend to be in rote verbal memory skills. Reading skil ls "
"usually exceed math skills; however, reading comprehension tends to be problematic. The behavior of "
children with VCFS can be either shy and withdrawn or disinhibited and impulsive. Thought problems can 
"be recognized during childhood and adolescence. Adults with VCFS are at risk for psychiatric disorders, "
particularly schizophrenia.  
Neural tube defects  
"Spina bifida occulta is usually accompanied by a depression or dimple, tuft of hair, soft fatty deposits, "
"port wine nevi, or a combination of these abnormalities on the skin over the spinal defect ; however, "
such signs may be absent. Spina bifida occulta doesn't usually cause neurologic dysfunction but 
occasionally is associated with foot weakness or bowel and bladder disturbances. Such disturbances are 
"especially likely during rapid growth phases, when the spinal cord's ascent within the vertebral column "
may be impaired by its abnormal adherence to other tissues. In both myelomeningocele and 
"meningocele, a saclike structure protrudes over the spine. Like spina bifida occulta, meningocele seldom "
"causes neurologic deficit. But myelomeningocele, depending on the level of the defect, cau ses "
"permanent neurologic dysfunction, such as flaccid or spastic paralysis and bowel and bladder "
"incontinence. Associated disorders include trophic skin disturbances (ulcerations, cyanosis), club foot, "
"knee contractures, hydrocephalus (in about 90% of patients), and possibly mental retardation, "
"Arnold-Chiari syndrome (in which part of the brain protrudes into the spinal canal), and curva ture of the "
spine.  
Cleft lip and cleft palate  
Orofacial cleft defects are divided into two major groups: cleft lip with or without cleft palate  or cleft 
palate only. Cleft of the lip may involve the alveolus (premaxilla) and may extend through the palate 
(hard and soft). Congenital clefts of the face occur most commonly in the upper lip. They can range from 
"a simple notch to a complete cleft from the lip edge, through the floor of the n ostril and through the "
alveolus. Cleft lip can occur on either or both sides of the midline but rarely along the m idline itself. A 
"cleft lip involving only one side is a unilateral cleft lip, and a cleft on both sides of  the midline is a "
bilateral cleft lip. When a bilateral cleft lip involves clefting of the alveolus on bo th sides of the 
"premaxilla, the premaxilla is separated from the maxilla into a freely moving segment. A cleft o f the "
"palate only may be partial or complete, involving only the soft palate or ex tending from the soft palate "
completely through the hard palate. A cleft palate can occur alone or with a cleft lip. Isolated cleft pal ate 
is more commonly associated with congenital defects other than isolated cleft lip with or withou t cleft 
"palate. (See Variations of cleft lip and cleft palate.) The constellation of U-shaped cleft palate,  "
"mandibular hypoplasia, and glossoptosis is known as Pierre Robin syndrome, or Robin syndr ome. Robin "
"syndrome can occur as an isolated defect or one feature of many different syndromes; therefore, a "
comprehensive genetic evaluation is suggested for infants with Robin syndrome. Because of the

Malignant brain tumors  
General ▪ Headache; mental activity changes ▪ Decreased motor strength and coordination ▪ 
Seizures; scanning speech ▪ Altered vital signs Localizing ▪ Third ventricle: changes in mental 
"activity and level of consciousness, nausea, pupillary dilation and sluggish light reflex; "
"later —paresis or ataxia ▪ Brain stem and pons: early —ipsilateral trigeminal, abducens, and "
"facial nerve palsies; later —cerebellar ataxia, tremors, other cranial nerve deficits ▪ Third or "
fourth ventricle or aqueduct of Sylvius: secondary hydrocephalus ▪ Thalamus or 
"hypothalamus: various endocrine, metabolic, autonomic, and behavioral changes  ▪ "
"Increased ICP , papilledema) ▪ Mental and behavioral change s ▪ Altered vital signs (increased "
"systolic pressure; widened pulse pressure, respiratory changes) ▪ Speech and sensory "
"disturbances ▪ In children, irritability, projectile vomiting  : headache (bifrontal or "
"bioccipital); worse in the morning; intensified  by coughing, straining, or sudden head "
"movements  abnormal reflexes, motor responses  : papilledema, nystagmus, hearing loss, "
"flashing lights, dizziness, ataxia, paresthesia of face, cranial nerve palsies (V, VI, VII, IX, X, "
"primarily sensory), hemipare sis, suboccipital tenderness; compression of supratentorial area "
produces other general and focal signs and symptoms  Skull changes (bony bulge) over 
"tumor ▪ Sphenoidal ridge, indenting optic nerve: unilateral visual changes and papilledema ▪ "
Prefrontal p arasagittal: personality and behavioral changes ▪ Motor cortex: contralateral 
motor changes ▪ Anterior fossa compressing both optic nerves and frontal lobes: bilateral 
vision loss ▪ Pressure on cranial nerves causing varying symptom  ▪ Decre ased visual acuity 
and other vision disturbances  Stiff neck and suboccipital discomfort   
Pituitary tumors  
"As pituitary adenomas grow, they replace normal glandular tissue and enlarge the sella "
"turcica, which houses the pituitary gland. The resulting p ressure on adjacent intracranial "
structures produces these typical clinical manifestations: Neurologic: frontal headache 
"visual symptoms, beginning with blurring and progressing to field cuts (hemianopsias) and "
"then unilateral blindness P cranial nerve inv olvement (III, IV, VI) from lateral extension of "
"the tumor, resulting in strabismus; double vision, with compensating head tilting and "
dizziness; conjugate deviation of gaze; nystagmus; lid ptosis; and limited eye movements 
increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (secondary hydrocephalus) personality changes or 
"dementia, if the tumor breaks through to the frontal lobes seizures rhinorrhea, if the tumor "
erodes the base of the skull pituitary apoplexy secondary to hemorrhagic infarction of the 
adenoma. Such hem orrhage may lead to both cardiovascular and adrenocortical collapse. 
"Endocrine: hypopituitarism, to some degree, in all patients with adenoma, becoming more "
obvious as the tumor replaces normal gland tissue (signs and symptoms include 
"amenorrhea, decreased  libido and impotence in men, skin changes [waxy appearance, "
"decreased wrinkles, and pigmentation], loss of axillary and pubic hair, lethargy, weakness, "
"increased fatigability, intolerance to cold, and constipation [because of decreased "
"corticotropin and t hyroid -stimulating hormone production]) addisonian crisis, precipitated "
"by stress and resulting in nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotension, and circulatory "
"collapse diabetes insipidus, resulting from extension to the hypothalamus prolactin -"
"secreting ad enomas (in 70% to 75%), with amenorrhea and galactorrhea GH -secreting "
"adenomas, with acromegaly corticotropin -secreting adenomas, with Cushing's syndrome.  "
Laryngeal cancer  
"In intrinsic laryngeal cancer, the dominant and earliest symptom is hoarseness t hat persists "
"longer than 3 weeks; in extrinsic cancer, it's a lump in the throat or pain or burning in the "
throat when drinking citrus juice or hot liquid. Later clinical effects of metastasis include 
"dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, enlarged cervical lymph node s, and pain radiating to the ear.  "
Thyroid cancer  
"The primary sign of thyroid cancer is a painless nodule, a hard nodule in an enlarged thyroid "
"gland, or palpable lymph nodes with thyroid enlargement. Eventually, the pressure of such a "
"nodule or enlarge ment causes hoarseness, dysphagia, dyspnea, and pain on palpation. If the "
"tumor is large enough to destroy the gland, hypothyroidism follows, with its typical "
"symptoms of low metabolism (mental apathy and sensitivity to cold). However, if the tumor "
"stimula tes excess thyroid hormone production, it induces symptoms of hyperthyroidism "
"(sensitivity to heat, restlessness, and hyperactivity). Other clinical features include diarrhea, "
"anorexia, irritability, vocal cord paralysis, and symptoms of distant metastasis . "
Malignant spinal neoplasms  
"Extramedullary tumors produce symptoms by pressing on nerve roots, the spinal cord, and "
"spinal vessels; intramedullary tumors, by destroying the parenchyma and compressing "
adjacent areas. Because intramedullary tumors may extend over several spinal cord 
"segments, their symptoms are more variable than those of extramedullary tumors. The "
following clinical effects are likely with all malignant spinal cord neoplasms: Pain —Most 
"severe directly over the  tumor, radiates around the trunk or down the limb on the affected "
"side and is unrelieved by bed rest. It may worsen when lying down or with straining, "
"coughing, or sneezing. Pain can be diffuse, occurring over all extremities. Generally, it "
progressively worsens and isn't relieved by medication. Motor symptoms —Asymmetric 
"spastic muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone, exaggerated reflexes, and a positive "
"Babinski's sign. If the tumor is at the level of the cauda equina, muscle flaccidity, muscle "
"wasting, w eakness, and progressive diminution in tendon reflexes are characteristic. "
"Sensory deficits —Contralateral loss of pain, temperature, and touch sensation (Brown -"
Séquard's syndrome). These losses are less obvious to the patient than functional motor 
changes.  Caudal lesions invariably produce paresthesia in the nerve distribution pathway of 
the involved roots. Bowel and bladder symptoms —Urine retention is an inevitable late sign 
with cord compression. Early signs include incomplete emptying or difficulty with the urine 
"stream, which is usually unnoticed or ignored. Cauda equina tumors cause bladder and "
bowel incontinence due to flaccid paralysis.  
Lung cancer  
"Because early -stage lung cancer usually produces no symptoms, this disease is usually in an "
advanced  state at diagnosis. These late -stage symptoms commonly lead to diagnosis: 
"Epidermoid and small cell carcinomas —smoker's cough, hoarseness, wheezing, dyspnea, "
"hemoptysis, and chest pain Adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma —fever, weakness, "
"weight loss , anorexia, and shoulder pain. In addition to their obvious interference with "
"respiratory function, lung tumors may also alter the production of hormones that regulate "
body function or homeostasis. Clinical conditions that result from such changes are know n 
as hormonal paraneoplastic syndromes: Gynecomastia may result from large cell carcinoma. 
Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (bone and joint pain from cartilage erosion due 
to abnormal production of growth hormone) may result from large cell carcinom a and 
adenocarcinoma. Cushing's and carcinoid syndromes may result from small cell carcinoma. 
Hypercalcemia may result from epidermoid tumors. Metastatic signs and symptoms vary 
"greatly, depending on the effect of tumors on intrathoracic and distant struct ures: bronchial "
"obstruction: hemoptysis, atelectasis, pneumonitis, dyspnea cervical thoracic sympathetic "
"nerve involvement: miosis, ptosis, exophthalmos, reduced sweating chest wall invasion: "
"piercing chest pain, increasing dyspnea, severe shoulder pain, r adiating down arm "
"esophageal compression: dysphagia local lymphatic spread: cough, hemoptysis, stridor, "
"pleural effusion pericardial involvement: pericardial effusion, tamponade, arrhythmias P "
"phrenic nerve involvement: dyspnea, shoulder pain, unilateral p aralyzed diaphragm, with "
"paradoxical motion recurrent nerve invasion: hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis vena caval "
"obstruction: venous distention and edema of face, neck, chest, and back. Distant metastasis "
"may involve any part of the body, most commonly th e central nervous system, liver, and "
bone.  
Breast cancer  
"Warning signals of possible breast cancer include: a lump or mass in the breast (a hard, "
nontender stony mass is usually malignant) change in symmetry or size of the breast change 
"in skin, thicke ning, scaly skin around the nipple, dimpling, edema (peau d'orange), or "
"ulceration change in skin temperature (a warm, hot, or pink area; suspect cancer in a "
nonlactating woman older than childbearing age until proven otherwise) unusual drainage 
"or dischar ge (a spontaneous discharge of any kind in a nonbreast -feeding, nonlactating "
woman warrants thorough investigation; so does any discharge produced by breast 
"manipulation (greenish black, white, creamy, serous, or bloody.) (If a breast -fed infant "
"rejects on e breast, this may suggest possible breast cancer.) change in the nipple, such as "
"itching, burning, erosion, or retraction pain (not usually a symptom of breast cancer unless "
"the tumor is advanced, but it should be investigated) bone metastasis, pathologic  bone "
"fractures, and hypercalcemia edema of the arm.  "
Gastric cancer  
"Early clues to gastric cancer are chronic dyspepsia and epigastric discomfort, followed in "
"later stages by weight loss, anorexia, feeling of fullness after eating, anemia, and fatigue.  If "
"the cancer is in the cardia, the first sign or symptom may be dysphagia and, later, vomiting "
(commonly coffeeground vomitus). Affected patients may also have blood in their stools. 
"The course of gastric cancer may be insidious or fulminating. Unfortuna tely, the patient "
typically treats himself with antacids or histamine blockers until the symptoms of advanced 
stages appear.  
Esophageal cancer  
Dysphagia and weight loss are the most common presenting symptoms. Dysphagia is mild 
"and intermittent at firs t, but it soon becomes constant. Pain, hoarseness, coughing, and "
esophageal obstruction follow. Cachexia usually develops.  
Pancreatic cancer  
"The most common features of pancreatic cancer are weight loss, abdominal or low back "
"pain, jaundice, and diarrh ea. Other generalized effects include fever, loss of appetite, "
"nausea, vomiting, weakness, indigestion, clay -colored stools, paleness, depression, skin "
"lesions (usually on the legs), and fatigue.  "
Colorectal cancer  
"Signs and symptoms of colorectal cance r result from local obstruction and, in later stages, "
"from direct extension to adjacent organs (bladder, prostate, ureters, vagina, sacrum) and "
"distant metastasis (usually liver). In the early stages, signs and symptoms are typically vague "
and depend on th e anatomic location and function of the bowel segment containing the 
"tumor. Later signs or symptoms usually include pallor, cachexia, ascites, hepatomegaly, or "
"lymphangiectasis. ELDER TIP Older patients may ignore bowel symptoms, believing that they "
"result  from constipation, poor diet, or hemorrhoids. Evaluate your older patient's responses "
to your questions carefully. On the right side of the colon (which absorbs water and 
"electrolytes), early tumor growth causes no signs of obstruction because the tumor t ends to "
"grow along the bowel rather than surround the lumen, and the fecal content in this area is "
"normally liquid. It may, however, cause black, tarry stools; anemia; and abdominal aching, "
"pressure, or dull cramps. As the disease progresses, the patient d evelops weakness, fatigue, "
"exertional dyspnea, vertigo and, eventually, diarrhea, obstipation, anorexia, weight loss, "
"vomiting, and other signs or symptoms of intestinal obstruction. In addition, a tumor on the "
"right side may be palpable. On the left side,  a tumor causes signs of an obstruction even in "
early stages because in this area stools are of a formed consistency. It commonly causes 
"rectal bleeding (in many cases ascribed to hemorrhoids), intermittent abdominal fullness or "
"cramping, and rectal pressu re. As the disease progresses, the patient develops obstipation, "
"P diarrhea, or “ribbon” or pencil -shaped stools. Typically, he notices that passage of stools "
"or flatus relieves the pain. At this stage, bleeding from the colon becomes obvious, with "
"dark or  bright red blood in the feces and mucus in or on the stools. With a rectal tumor, the "
"first symptom is a change in bowel habits, in many cases beginning with an urgent need to "
defecate on arising (morning diarrhea) or obstipation alternating with diarrhea . Other signs 
"are blood or mucus in stools and a sense of incomplete evacuation. Late in the disease, pain "
"begins as a feeling of rectal fullness that later becomes a dull, and sometimes constant, ache "
confined to the rectum or sacral region.  
Kidney cancer  
"Kidney cancer produces a classic clinical triad (hematuria, pain, and a palpable mass), but "
any one may be the first sign of cancer. Microscopic or gross hematuria (which may be 
intermittent) suggests that the cancer has spread to the renal  pelvis. Constant abdominal or 
"flank pain may be dull or, if the cancer causes bleeding or blood clots, acute and colicky. The "
"mass is generally smooth, firm, and nontender. All three signs coexist in only about 10% of "
"patients. Other signs include fever ( perhaps from hemorrhage or necrosis), hypertension "
"(from compression of the renal artery with renal parenchymal ischemia), rapidly progressing "
"hypercalcemia (possibly from ectopic parathyroid hormone production by the tumor), and "
"urine retention. Weight lo ss, edema in the legs, nausea, and vomiting signal advanced "
disease.  
Liver cancer  
"Clinical effects of liver cancer include: a mass in the right upper quadrant tender, nodular "
"liver on palpation severe pain in the epigastrium or the right upper quadrant  bruit, hum, or "
"rubbing sound if tumor involves a large part of the liver weight loss, weakness, anorexia, "
fever occasional jaundice or ascites occasional evidence of metastasis through venous 
"system to lungs, from lymphatics to regional lymph nodes, or by  direct invasion of portal "
veins dependent edema.  
Bladder cancer  
"In early stages, about 25% of patients with bladder tumors have no symptoms. Commonly, "
"the first sign is gross, painless, intermittent hematuria (in many cases with clots in the "
urine). M any patients with invasive lesions have suprapubic pain after voiding. Other signs 
"and symptoms include bladder irritability, urinary frequency, nocturia, and dribbling.  "
Gallbladder and bile duct cancer  
"Clinically, gallbladder cancer is almost indistin guishable from cholecystitis —pain in the "
"epigastrium or right upper quadrant, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. "
"However, chronic, progressively severe pain in an afebrile patient suggests malignancy. In "
"patients with simple gallstones,  pain is sporadic. Another telling clue to malignancy is "
"palpable gallbladder (right upper quadrant), with obstructive jaundice. Some patients may "
also have hepatosplenomegaly. Progressive profound jaundice is commonly the first sign of 
obstruction due to extrahepatic bile duct cancer. The jaundice is usually accompanied by 
"chronic pain in the epigastrium or the right upper quadrant, radiating to the back. Other "
"common signs or symptoms, if associated with active cholecystitis, include pruritus, skin "
"excori ations, anorexia, weight loss, chills, and fever.  "
Prostate cancer  
Signs and symptoms of prostate cancer appear only in the advanced stages and include 
"difficulty initiating a urine stream, dribbling, urine retention, unexplained cystitis and, rarely, "
"hematuria. Pain may be present in the lower back, with urination, ejaculation, and bowel "
movement.  
Testicular cancer  
"The first sign is usually a firm, painless, and smooth testicular mass, varying in size and "
sometimes producing a sense of testicular he aviness. When such a tumor causes chorionic 
"gonadotropin or estrogen production, gynecomastia and nipple tenderness may result. In "
"advanced stages, signs and symptoms include ureteral obstruction, abdominal mass, cough, "
"hemoptysis, shortness of breath, wei ght loss, fatigue, pallor, and lethargy.  "
Penile cancer  
"In a circumcised man, early signs of penile cancer include a small circumscribed lesion, a "
"pimple, or a sore on the penis. In an uncircumcised man, however, such early symptoms "
"may go unnoticed, so  penile cancer first becomes apparent when it causes late -stage signs "
"or symptoms, such as pain, hemorrhage, dysuria, purulent discharge, and obstruction of the "
urinary meatus. Rarely is metastasis the first sign of penile cancer.  
Cervical cancer  
Preinvasive cervical cancer produces no symptoms or other clinically apparent changes. 
"Early invasive cervical cancer causes abnormal vaginal bleeding, persistent vaginal discharge, "
"and postcoital pain and bleeding. In advanced stages, it causes pelvic pai n, vaginal leakage "
"of urine and feces from a fistula, anorexia, weight loss, and anemia.  "
Uterine cancer  
"Uterine enlargement, and persistent and unusual premenopausal bleeding, or any "
"postmenopausal bleeding, are the most common indications of uterine c ancer. The "
"discharge may at first be watery and bloodstreaked, but it gradually becomes more bloody. "
"Other signs or symptoms, such as pain and weight loss, don't appear until the cancer is well "
advanced.  
Vaginal cancer  
"Commonly, the patient with vagina l cancer has experienced abnormal bleeding and "
"discharge. Also, she may have a small or large, in many cases firm, ulcerated lesion in any "
"part of the vagina. As the cancer progresses, it commonly spreads to the bladder (producing "
"frequent voiding and blad der pain), the rectum (bleeding), vulva (lesion), pubic bone (pain), "
or other surrounding tissues.  
Ovarian cancer  
"Typically, symptoms vary with the size of the tumor. An ovary may grow to considerable size "
"before it produces overt symptoms. Occasionall y, in the early stages, ovarian cancer causes "
"vague abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, and other mild GI disturbances. As it progresses, it "
"causes urinary frequency, constipation, pelvic discomfort, distention, and weight loss. "
"Tumor rupture, torsion, or inf ection may cause pain, which, in young patients, may mimic "
appendicitis. Granulosa cell tumors have feminizing effects (such as bleeding between 
"periods in premenopausal women); conversely, arrhenoblastomas have virilizing effects. "
"Advanced ovarian cancer causes ascites, rarely postmenopausal bleeding and pain, and "
symptoms relating to metastatic sites (most commonly pleural effusions).  
Cancer of the vulva  
"In 50% of patients, cancer of the vulva begins with vulval pruritus, bleeding, or a small vulval "
"mass (which may start as a small ulcer on the surface; eventually, it becomes infected and "
"painful), so such symptoms call for immediate diagnostic evaluation. Seventy percent of "
"lesions develop on the labia, but tumors can be found on the clitoris, Barthol in's P glands, "
and perineum. Less common indications include a mass in the groin or abnormal urination 
or defecation.  
Fallopian tube cancer  
"Generally, early stage fallopian tube cancer produces no symptoms. Late -stage disease is "
"characterized by an enl arged abdomen with a palpable mass, amber -colored vaginal "
"discharge, excessive bleeding during menstruation or, at other times, abdominal cramps, "
"frequent urination, bladder pressure, persistent constipation, weight loss, and unilateral "
colicky pain produc ed by hydrops tubae profluens. (This last symptom occurs when the 
"abdominal end of the fallopian tube closes, causing the tube to become greatly distended "
until its accumulated P secretions suddenly overflow into the uterus.) Metastasis develops 
"by local e xtension or by lymphatic spread to the abdominal organs or to the pelvic, aortic, "
and inguinal lymph nodes. Extra -abdominal metastasis is rare.  
Primary malignant bone tumors  
Bone pain is the most common indication of primary malignant bone tumors. It's  generally 
more intense at night; isn't usually associated with mobility. The pain is dull and usually 
"localized, although it may be referred from the hip or spine and result in weakness or a limp. "
Another common sign is a mass or tumor. The tumor site may  be tender and may swell; the 
"tumor itself is often palpable. Pathologic fractures are common. In late stages, patient may "
"be cachectic, with fever and impaired mobility.  "
Multiple myeloma  
"The earliest indication of multiple myeloma is severe, constant back and rib pain that "
increases with exercise and may be worse at night. Arthritic symptoms may also occur: 
"achiness, joint swelling, and tenderness, possibly from vertebral compression. Othe r effects "
"include fatigue, fever, malaise, slight evidence of peripheral neuropathy (such as peripheral "
"paresthesia), and pathologic fractures. As multiple myeloma progresses, symptoms of "
"vertebral compression may become acute, accompanied by anemia, weigh t loss, thoracic "
"deformities (ballooning), and loss of body height (5″ [12.7 cm] or more) due to vertebral "
collapse. Renal complications such as pyelonephritis (caused by tubular damage from large 
"amounts of Bence Jones protein, hypercalcemia, and hyperuri cemia) may occur. Severe, "
recurrent infection such as pneumonia may follow damage to nerves associated with 
respiratory function.  
Basal cell epithelioma  
Three types of basal cell epithelioma occur: Noduloulcerative lesions usually occur on the 
"face, pa rticularly the forehead, eyelid margins, and nasolabial folds. In early stages, these "
"lesions are small, smooth, pinkish, and translucent papules. Telangiectatic vessels cross the "
"surface, and the lesions are occasionally pigmented. As the lesions enlarge,  their centers "
become depressed and their borders become firm and elevated. Ulceration P and local 
"invasion eventually occur. These ulcerated tumors, known as rodent ulcers, rarely "
"metastasize; however, if untreated, they can spread to vital areas and beco me infected or "
cause massive hemorrhage if they invade large blood vessels. Superficial basal cell 
epitheliomas are multiple in many cases and commonly occur on the chest and back. 
"They're oval or irregularly shaped, lightly pigmented plaques, with sharply  defined, slightly "
"elevated threadlike borders. Due to superficial erosion, these lesions appear scaly and have "
"small, atrophic areas in the center that resemble psoriasis or eczema. They're usually "
chronic and don't tend to invade other areas. Superficial  basal cell epitheliomas are related 
to ingestion of or exposure to arsenic -containing compounds. Sclerosing basal cell 
"epitheliomas (morphea -like epitheliomas) are waxy, sclerotic, yellow to white plaques "
"without distinct borders. Occurring on the head an d neck, sclerosing basal cell epitheliomas "
commonly look like small patches of scleroderma.  
Squamous cell carcinoma  
"Squamous cell carcinoma commonly develops on the skin of the face, the ears, the dorsa of "
"the hands and forearms, and other sun -damaged areas. Lesions on sun -damaged skin tend "
to be less invasive and less likely to metastasize than lesions on unexposed skin. Notable 
exceptions to this tendency are squamous cell lesions on the lower lip and the ears. P These 
are almost invariably markedly i nvasive metastatic lesions with a generally poor prognosis. 
Transformation from a premalignant lesion to squamous cell carcinoma may begin with 
induration and inflammation of the preexisting lesion. When squamous cell carcinoma arises 
"from normal skin, the  nodule grows slowly on a firm, indurated base. If untreated, this "
nodule eventually ulcerates and invades underlying tissues. (See Staging squamous cell 
"carcinoma, page 874.) Metastasis can occur to the regional lymph nodes, producing "
"characteristic syste mic symptoms of pain, malaise, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia.  "
Malignant melanoma  
"Common sites for melanoma are on the head and neck in men, on the legs in women, and "
on the backs of persons exposed to excessive sunlight. Up to 70% arise from a preexi sting 
"nevus. It rarely appears in the conjunctiva, choroid, pharynx, mouth, vagina, or anus. "
"Suspect melanoma when any skin lesion or nevus enlarges, changes color, becomes "
"inflamed or sore, itches, ulcerates, bleeds, undergoes textural changes, or shows s igns of "
surrounding pigment regression (halo nevus or vitiligo). (See Recognizing potentially 
"malignant nevi, page 876.) Each type of melanoma has special characteristics: Superficial "
"spreading melanoma, the most common, usually develops between ages 40 an d 50. Such a "
"lesion arises on an area of chronic irritation. In women, it's most common between the "
"knees and ankles; in Blacks and Asians, on the toe webs and soles (lightly pigmented areas "
"subject to trauma). Characteristically, this melanoma has a red, white, and blue color over a "
"brown or black background and an irregular, notched margin. Its surface is irregular, with "
"small, elevated tumor nodules that may ulcerate and bleed. Horizontal growth may "
"continue for many years; when vertical growth begins, p rognosis worsens. Nodular "
"melanoma usually develops between ages 40 and 50, grows vertically, invades the dermis, "
"and metastasizes early. Such a lesion is usually a polypoidal nodule, with uniformly dark "
"discoloration (it may be grayish), and looks like a blackberry. Occasionally, this melanoma is "
"fleshcolored, with flecks of pigment around its base (possibly inflamed). Lentigo maligna "
melanoma is relatively rare. It arises from a lentigo maligna on an exposed skin surface and 
usually occurs between ages 60  and 70. This lesion looks like a large (3 - to 6-cm) flat freckle 
"of tan, brown, black, whitish, or slate color and has irregularly scattered black nodules on "
"the surface. It develops slowly, usually over P many years, and eventually may ulcerate. This "
"melanoma commonly develops under the fingernails, on the face, and on the back of the "
hands.  
Kaposi's sarcoma  
"The initial sign of Kaposi's sarcoma is one or more obvious lesions in various shapes, sizes, "
"and colors (ranging from red -brown to dark purple) appearing most commonly on the skin, "
"buccal mucosa, hard and soft palates, lips, gums, tongue, tonsils, conjunctiva, and sclera. In "
"advanced disease, the lesions may join, becoming one large plaque. Untreated lesions may "
"appear as large, ulcerative masses.  Other signs and symptoms include: health history of "
AIDS pain (if the sarcoma advances beyond the early stages or if a lesion breaks down or 
impinges on nerves or organs) edema from lymphatic obstruction dyspnea (in cases of 
"pulmonary involvement), wheezi ng, hypoventilation, and respiratory distress from bronchial "
"blockage. The most common extracutaneous sites are the lungs and GI tract (esophagus, "
"oropharynx, and epiglottis). Signs and symptoms of disease progression and metastasis "
include severe pulmonar y involvement and GI involvement leading to digestive problems.  
Hodgkin's lymphoma  
The first sign of Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of one of the cervical 
"lymph nodes (but sometimes the axillary, mediastinal, or inguinal lymph nodes) , "
occasionally in a patient who gives a history of recent upper respiratory infection. In older 
"patients, the first signs and symptoms may be nonspecific —persistent fever, night sweats, "
"fatigue, P weight loss, and malaise. Rarely, if the mediastinum is ini tially involved, Hodgkin's "
lymphoma may produce respiratory symptoms. Another early and characteristic indication 
"of Hodgkin's lymphoma is pruritus, which, although mild at first, becomes acute as the "
disease progresses. Other symptoms depend on the degree  and location of systemic 
"involvement. Lymph nodes may enlarge rapidly, producing pain and obstruction, or enlarge "
slowly and painlessly for months or years. It isn't unusual to see the lymph nodes “wax and 
"wane,” but they usually don't return to normal. S ooner or later, most patients develop "
"systemic manifestations, including enlargement of retroperitoneal nodes and nodular "
"infiltrations of the spleen, the liver, and bones. At this late stage other symptoms include "
"edema of the face and neck, progressive a nemia, possible jaundice, nerve pain, and "
increased susceptibility to infection.  
Non -Hodgkin's lymphoma  
"Usually, the first indication of non -Hodgkin's lymphoma is swelling of the lymph glands, "
"enlarged tonsils and adenoids, and painless, rubbery nodes in the cervical supraclavicular "
"areas. In children, these nodes are usually in the cervical region, and the disease causes "
"dyspnea and coughing. As the lymphoma progresses, the patient develops symptoms "
"specific to the area involved and systemic complaints  of fatigue, malaise, weight loss, fever, "
and night sweats.  
Mycosis fungoides  
"The first sign of MF may be generalized erythroderma, possibly associated with itching. "
"Eventually, MF evolves into varied combinations of infiltrated, thickened, or scaly pa tches, "
"tumors, or ulcerations.  "
Acute leukemia  
Signs of acute leukemia may be gradual or abrupt; they include high fever accompanied by 
"thrombocytopenia and abnormal bleeding (such as nosebleeds), gingival bleeding, purpura, "
"ecchymoses, petechiae, easy bruising after minor trauma, and prolonged menses. "
"Nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as low -grade fever, weakness, and lassitude, may "
persist for days or months before visible symptoms appear. Other insidious signs and 
"symptoms include pallor, chills, a nd recurrent infections. In addition, ALL, AML, and acute "
"monoblastic leukemia may cause dyspnea, anemia, fatigue, malaise, tachycardia, "
"palpitations, systolic ejection murmur, and abdominal or bone pain. Specific AML symptoms "
"include local infections (lar yngitis, pharyngitis, meningitis) or septicemia. Joint arthralgias "
and abdominal fullness (from enlarged spleen) may occur. Specific ALL symptoms include 
"night sweats, shortness of breath, anorexia, weight loss, kepatosplenomegaly, and lymph "
adenopathy. Wh en leukemic cells cross the blood -brain barrier and thereby escape the 
"effects of systemic chemotherapy, the patient may develop meningeal leukemia (confusion, "
"lethargy, headache).  "
Chronic myelogenous leukemia  
"Typically, during the chronic phase, CML i nduces the following clinical effects: anemia "
"(fatigue, weakness, decreased exercise tolerance, pallor, dyspnea, tachycardia, and "
"headache) thrombocytopenia, with resulting bleeding and clotting disorders (retinal "
"hemorrhage, ecchymoses, hematuria, melena,  bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and easy "
"bruising) hepatosplenomegaly, with abdominal discomfort and pain in splenic infarction "
from leukemic cell infiltration. Other signs and symptoms include sternal and rib tenderness 
from leukemic infiltrations of the peri osteum; low -grade fever; weight loss; anorexia; renal 
"calculi or gouty arthritis from increased uric acid excretion; occasionally, prolonged infection "
"and ankle edema; and, rarely, priapism and vascular insufficiency. Acceleration of the "
"disease process re sults in fever, night sweats, splenomegaly, and bone pain.  "
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia  
CLL is the most benign and the most slowly progressive form of leukemia. Clinical signs 
"derive from the infiltration of leukemic cells in bone marrow, lymphoid tiss ue, and organ "
"systems. In early stages, patients usually complain of fatigue, malaise, fever, and nodal "
"enlargement. They're particularly susceptible to infection. In advanced stages, patients may "
"experience severe fatigue and weight loss, with liver or sp leen enlargement, bone "
"tenderness, and edema from lymph node obstruction. Pulmonary infiltrates may appear "
"when lung parenchyma is involved. Skin infiltrations, manifested by macular to nodular "
"eruptions, occur in about one -half of the cases of CLL. As the  disease progresses, bone "
"marrow involvement may lead to anemia, pallor, weakness, dyspnea, tachycardia, "
"palpitations, bleeding, and infection. Opportunistic fungal, viral, and bacterial infections "
commonly occur in late stages  
Cerebral palsy  
"Spastic cerebral palsy is characterized by hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, increased stretch reflexes, "
"rapid alternating muscle contraction and relaxation, muscle weakness, underdevelopment of affected "
"limbs, muscle contraction in response to manipulation, and a tendency to contractures. Typical ly, a child "
"with spastic CP walks on his toes with a scissors gait, crossing one foot in front of the other. In athetoid "
"cerebral palsy, involuntary movements —grimacing, wormlike writhing, dystonia, and sharp jerks —impair "
"voluntary movement. Usually, these involuntary movements affect the arms more sever ely than the legs; "
involuntary facial movements may make speech difficult. These athetoid movements become m ore 
"severe during stress, decrease with relaxation, and disappear entirely during sleep. Ataxic cerebral palsy "
"is characterized by disturbed balance, incoordination (especially of the arms), hypoactive reflexes, "
"nystagmus, muscle weakness, tremor, lack of leg movement during infancy, and a widebased gait as the "
child begins to walk. Ataxia makes sudden or fine movements almost impossible. Some children with CP 
"display a combination of these clinical features. In most, impaired motor function makes eatin g "
(especially swallowing) difficult and retards growth and development. Up to 40% of these children are 
"mentally retarded, about 25% have seizure disorders, and about 80% have impaired speech. Many als o "
"have dental abnormalities, vision and hearing defects, and reading disabilities. "
Hydrocephalus  
"In infants, the unmistakable sign of hydrocephalus is rapidly increasing head circumference, clearly "
disproportionate to the infant's growth. Other characteristic changes include widening and bu lging of the 
"fontanels; distended scalp veins; thin, shiny, and fragile-looking scalp skin; and underdeveloped ne ck "
"muscles. (See Signs of hydrocephalus.) In severe hydrocephalus, the roof of the orbit is depressed, the "
"eyes are displaced downward, and the sclerae are prominent. Sclera seen above the iris is called the "
"“setting-sun sig n.” A high-pitched, shrill cry, abnormal muscle tone of the legs, irritability, anorexia, and "
"projectile vomiting commonly occur. In adults and older children, indicators of hydrocephalu s include "
"decreased level of consciousness (LOC), ataxia, incontinence, loss of coordination, and impaired intell ect.  "
Cerebral aneurysm  
"Occasionally, rupture of a cerebral aneurysm causes premonitory symptoms that last several days, such "
"as headache, nuchal rigidity, stiff back and legs, and intermittent nausea. Usually, however, onset is "
"abrupt and without warning, causing a sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting and, depending on "
"the severity and location of bleeding, altered consciousness (including deep coma). Bleeding cau ses "
"meningeal irritation, resulting in nuchal rigidity, back and leg pain, fever, restlessness, irritabilit y, "
"occasional seizures, and blurred vision. Bleeding into the brain tissues causes hemiparesis, hemisensory "
"defects, dysphagia, and visual defects. If the aneurysm is near the internal carotid artery, it compresses "
"the oculomotor nerve and causes diplopia, ptosis, dilated pupil, and inability to rotate the e ye. The "
"severity of symptoms varies considerably from patient to patient, depending on the site and amou nt of "
"bleeding. To better describe their conditions, patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms are grouped as "
follows: 
Grade I (minimal bleed): Patient is alert with no neurologic deficit; he may have a slight headache and 
"nuchal rigidity. Grade II (mild bleed): Patient is alert, with a mild to severe headache, nuchal ri gidity and, "
"possibly, third-nerve palsy. Grade III (moderate bleed): Patient is confused or drowsy, with nuchal rigidi ty "
"and, possibly, a mild focal deficit. Grade IV (severe bleed): Patient is stuporous, with nuchal rigidi ty and, "
"possibly, mild to severe hemiparesis. Grade V (moribund; commonly fatal): If nonfatal, pa tient is in deep "
"coma or decerebrate. Generally, cerebral aneurysm poses three major threats: Death from increased "
"ICP: Increased ICP may push the brain downward, impair brain stem function, and cut off blood supply to "
"the part of the brain that supports vital functions. Rebleed: Generally, after the initial bleeding episod e, a "
"clot forms and seals the rupture, which reinforces the wall of the aneurysm for 7 to 10 days. However, "
"after the 7th day, fibrinolysis begins to dissolve the clot and increases the risk of rebleeding. Si gns and "
symptoms are similar to those accompanying the initial hemorrhage. Rebleeds during the fi rst 24 hours 
"after initial hemorrhage aren't uncommon, and they contribute to cerebral aneurysm's high m ortality. "
"Vasospasm: Why this occurs isn't clearly understood. Usually, vasospasm occurs in blood vessels "
"adjacent to the cerebral aneurysm, but it may extend to major vessels of the brain, causing ischemia and "
altered brain function. Other complications of cerebral aneurysm include pulmonary embolism  (a 
"possible adverse effect of deep vein thrombosis or aneurysm treatment) and acute hydrocephalus, "
occurring as CSF accumulates in the cranial cavity because of blockage by blood or adhesions. 
Arteriovenous malformations  
An AVM may be asymptomatic until complications occur; these may include rupture and a resulting  
"sudden bleed in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Arteriovenous malformations vary in size and "
"location within the brain. Systolic bruit may be auscultated over the carotid artery, m astoid process, or "
orbit on examination. Symptoms that occur prior to an AVM rupture are related to smaller and slow er 
"bleeding from the abnormal vessels, which are usually fragile because their structure is abnormal. "
"In more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage from the malformation is the first symptom. "
"Depending on the location and the severity of the bleed, the hemorrhage can be profoun dly disabling or "
fatal. The risk of bleeding from an AVM is approximately 2% to 4% per year. The first symptoms oft en 
"include headache, seizure, or other sudden neurological problems, such as vision problems, weakness, "
"inability to move a limb or a side of the body, lack of sensation in part of the body , or abnormal "
"sensations, such as ringing and numbness. Symptoms are the same as for stroke. The individual with an "
"AVM may complain of chronic mild headache, a sudden and severe headache, or a localized or general "
headache. The headache may resemble migraine and vomiting may occur. Seizures may result from fo cal 
neurologic   deficits (depending on the location of the AVM) resulting from compression and diminish ed 
"perfusion. Symptoms of intracranial (intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural) hemorrhage result. "
Muscle weakness and decreased sensation can occur in any part of the body. Mental status change can 
"occur where the individual appears sleepy, stuporous, lethargic, confused, disoriented, or irritable. "
"Additional symptoms may include stiff neck, speech or sense of smell impairment, dysfunctional "
"movement, fainting, facial paralysis, eyelid drooping, tinnitus, dizziness, and decreased level  of "
"consciousness (LOC). If an AVM bleeds once, the risk is greater that it will bleed again in the future. "
Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages are the most common first symptoms of cerebral 
"arteriovenous malformation. In some cases, symptoms may also occur due to lack of blood flow t o an "
"area of the brain (ischemia), compression or distortion of brain tissue by large AVMs, or abnormal brain "
"development in the area of the malformation. Progressive loss of nerve cells in the brain  may occur, "
caused by mechanical (pressure) and ischemic (lack of blood supply) factors. 
Headache  
"Initially, migraine headaches usually produce unilateral, pulsating pain, which later becomes m ore "
"generalized. They're commonly preceded by a scintillating scotoma, hemianopsia, unilateral pare sthesia, "
"or speech disorders. The patient may experience irritability, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and "
photophobia. (See Clinical features of migraine headaches.) Both muscle contraction and 
"tractioninflammatory vascular headaches produce a dull, persistent ache, tender spots on the head and "
"neck, and a feeling of tightness around the head, with a characteristic “hatband ” distribution. The pain is "
"usually severe and unrelenting. If caused by intracranial bleeding, these headaches may result in "
"neurologic deficits, such as paresthesia and muscle weakness; narcotics may fail to relieve pain in these "
"cases. If caused by a tumor, pain is most severe when the patient awakens.  "
Seizure disorder  
"The hallmarks of seizure disorder are recurring seizures, which can be classified as partial or generalized "
(some patients may be affected by more than one type). Partial seizures arise from a localiz ed area of 
"the brain, causing specific symptoms. In some patients, partial seizure activity may spread to the entire "
"brain, causing a generalized seizure. Partial seizures include simple partial (jacksonian) and  complex "
partial seizures (psychomotor or temporal lobe). A simple partial motor-type seizure b egins as a localized 
motor seizure characterized by a spread of abnormal activity to adjacent areas of the brain. It typicall y 
"produces stiffening or jerking in one extremity, accompanied by a tingling sensation in the same area. "
"For example, it may start in the thumb and spread to the entire hand and arm. The "
"patient seldom loses consciousness, although the seizure may progress to a generalized seizu re. A simple "
"partial sensory-type seizure involves perceptual distortion, which can include hallucinatio ns. The "
symptoms of a complex partial seizure vary but usually include purposeless behavior. The patient 
experiences an aura immediately before the seizure. An aura represents the beginning of abnormal 
"electrical discharges within a focal area of the brain and may include a pungent smell, GI distress (nausea "
"or indigestion), a rising or sinking feeling in the stomach, a dreamy feeling, an unusua l taste, or a visual "
"disturbance. Overt signs of a complex partial seizure include a glassy stare, picking at one's clothes, "
"aimless wandering, lipsmacking or chewing motions, and unintelligible speech; th ese signs may last for "
just a few seconds or as long as 20 minutes. Mental confusion may last several minu tes after the seizure; 
"as a result, an observer may mistakenly suspect intoxication with alcohol or drugs or psychosis. "
"Generalized seizures, as the term suggests, cause a generalized electrical abnormality within the brain "
"and include several distinct types: Absence (petit mal) seizures occur most commonly in children, "
"although they may affect adults as well. They usually begin with a brief change in lev el of consciousness, "
"indicated by blinking or rolling of the eyes, a blank stare, and slight mouth movements. T here's little or "
no tonic-clonic movement. The patient retains his posture and continues preseizure activ ity without 
"difficulty. Typically, each seizure lasts from 1 to 10 seconds. If not properly treated, sei zures can recur as "
often as 100 times per day. An absence seizure may progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A 
"myoclonic (bilateral massive epileptic myoclonus) seizure is characterized by brief, involunta ry muscular "
"jerks of the body or extremities, which may occur in a rhythmic fashion and may precede generalized "
tonic-clonic seizures by months or years. A generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure ty pically begins 
"with a loud cry, precipitated by air rushing from the lungs through the vocal cords. The pati ent then falls "
"to the ground, losing consciousness. The body stiffens (tonic phase) and then alternates between "
"episodes of muscular spasm and relaxation (clonic phase). Tongue-biting, incontinence, labored "
"breathing, apnea, and subsequent cyanosis may also occur. The seizure stops in 2 to 5 minutes, w hen "
abnormal electrical conduction of the neurons is completed. The patient then regains conscio usness but 
"is somewhat confused and may have difficulty talking. If he can talk, he may complain of drowsiness, "
"fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, and arm or leg weakness. He may fall into deep sleep after the "
seizure. These seizures may start as facial seizures and spread to become generalized. An akinetic seizu re 
is characterized by a general loss of postural tone (the patient falls in a flaccid state) and a temporary 
loss of consciousness. It occurs in young children and is sometimes called a “drop attack ” because it 
causes the child to fall. Status epilepticus is a continuous seizure state that can occur in all se izure types. 
"The most life-threatening example is generalized tonicclonic status epilepticus, a continuou s generalized "
tonic-clonic seizure without intervening return of consciousness. Status epilepticus is accomp anied by 
"respiratory distress. It can result from abrupt withdrawal of anticonvulsant medications, hypoxic "
"encephalopathy, acute head trauma, metabolic encephalopathy, or septicemia secondary to encephalitis "
or meningitis.  
Stroke  
"Clinical features of stroke vary with the artery affected (and, consequently, the portion of the brain  it "
"supplies), the severity of damage, and the extent of collateral circulation that develops t o help the brain "
"compensate for decreased blood supply. If the stroke occurs in the left hemisphere, it produces "
"symptoms on the right side; if in the right hemisphere, symptoms are on the left si de. However, a stroke "
that causes cranial nerve damage produces signs of cranial nerve dysfunction on the same side as the 
hemorrhage. Symptoms are usually classified according to the artery affected: Middle ce rebral artery: 
"aphasia, dysphasia, visual field cuts, and hemiparesis on affected side (more severe in the face and arm "
"than in the leg) Carotid artery: weakness, paralysis, numbness, sensory changes, and visual disturbances "
"on affected side; altered level of consciousness (LOC), bruits, headaches, aphasia, and ptosis "
"Vertebrobasilar artery: weakness on affected side, numbness around lips and mouth, visual field cuts, "
"diplopia, poor coordination, dysphagia, slurred speech, dizziness, amnesia, and ataxia Anterior cerebral "
"artery: confusion, weakness, and numbness (especially in the leg) on affected side, incontinence, loss of "
"coordination, impaired motor and sensory functions, and personality changes Posterior cereb ral arteries: "
"visual field cuts, sensory impairment, dyslexia, coma, and cortical blindness; typically, paralysis i s absent. "
"Symptoms can also be classified as premonitory, generalized, and focal. Premonitory symptoms, such as "
"drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and mental confusion, are rare. Generalized symptoms, such as "
"headache, vomiting, mental impairment, seizures, coma, nuchal rigidity, fever, and disorientati on, are "
"typical. Focal symptoms, such as sensory and reflex changes, reflect the site of hemorrhage or infarct and "
may worsen. 
Meningitis  
"The cardinal signs of meningitis are infection (fever, chills, and malaise) and increased intracranial "
"pressure (ICP; headache, vomiting and, rarely, papilledema). Signs of positive Brudzinski's and Kernig's "
"signs, exaggerated and symmetrical deep tendon reflexes, and opisthotonos (a spasm in which the back "
and extremities arch backward so that the body rests on the head and heels). (See Two signs of 
"meningitis, pages 198 and 199.) Other manifestations of meningitis are irritability; sinus arr hythmias; "
"photophobia, diplopia, and other visual problems; and delirium, deep stupor, and coma. An  infant may "
"not show clinical signs of infection but may be fretful and refuse to eat. Such an infant may vom it often, "
leading to dehydration; this prevents a bulging fontanel and thus masks this important sign of increased 
"ICP. As the illness progresses, twitching, seizures (in 30% of infants), or coma may develop. M ost older "
"children have the same symptoms as adults. In subacute meningitis, the onset may be insidi ous. "
Encephalitis  
"All viral forms of encephalitis have similar clinical features, although certain differ ences do occur. "
"Usually, the acute illness begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting and progresses to "
include signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation (stiff neck and back) and neuronal damage 
"(drowsiness, coma, paralysis, seizures, ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, and organic psychoses). After "
"the acute phase of the illness, coma may persist for days or weeks. The severity of arbovirus encephal itis "
may range from subclinical to rapidly fatal necrotizing disease. Herpes encephalitis also produces signs 
and symptoms that vary from subclinical to acute and commonly fatal fulminating disease. Associate d 
effects include disturbances of taste or smell.  
Brain abscess  
"Onset varies according to cause, but generally brain abscess produces clinical effects similar to t hose of a "
brain tumor. Early symptoms result from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and include constant 
"intractable headache, worsened by straining; nausea; vomiting; and focal or generalized seizures. Typical "
"later symptoms include ocular disturbances, such as nystagmus, decreased vision, and unequal pupil "
size. Other features differ with the site of the abscess: temporal lobe abscess: auditory-recepti ve 
"dysphasia, central facial weakness, and hemiparesis cerebellar abscess: dizziness, coarse nystagmus, "
"gaze weakness on lesion side, tremor, and ataxia frontal lobe abscess: expressive dysphasia, hemiparesis "
"with unilateral motor seizure, drowsiness, inattention, and mental function impairment. Signs of "
"infection, such as fever, pallor, and bradycardia, are absent until late stages unless they result from th e "
"predisposing condition. If the abscess is encapsulated, they may never appear. Depending on abscess "
"size and location, level of consciousness (LOC) varies from drowsiness to deep stupor.  "
Huntington's disease  
Onset is insidious. The patient eventually becomes totally dependent — emotionally and 
"physically —through loss of musculoskeletal control, and he develops progressively severe choreic "
"movements. Such movements are rapid, usually violent, and purposeless. Initially, they're unilateral and "
"more prominent in the face and arms than in the legs, progressing from mild fidgeting to gri macing, "
"tongue smacking, dysarthria (indistinct speech), athetoid movements (especially of the hands) rela ted to "
"emotional state, and torticollis. Ultimately, the patient with Huntington's disease develo ps progressive "
"dementia, although the dementia doesn't always progress at the same rate as the chorea. Dementia can "
"be mild at first, but eventually causes severe disruption of the personality. Personality  changes include "
"obstinacy, carelessness, untidiness, moodiness, apathy, inappropriate behavior, loss of me mory and "
"concentration and, occasionally, paranoia.  "
Parkinson's disease 
The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease are muscle rigidity and akinesia and an insidious res ting 
"tremor that begins in the fingers (unilateral pill-roll tremor), increases during stress or anxiety, and "
decreases with purposeful movement and sleep. Muscle rigidity results in resistance to passive muscle 
"stretching, which may be uniform (leadpipe rigidity) or jerky (cogwheel rigidity). A kinesia causes the "
patient to walk with difficulty (gait lacks normal parallel motion and may be retropulsive or propu lsive) 
"and produces a high-pitched, monotone voice; drooling; a masklike facial expression; lo ss of posture "
"control (the patient walks with body bent forward); and dysarthria, dysphagia, or both. Occasionally, "
"akinesia may also cause oculogyric crises (eyes are fixed upward, with involuntary tonic mov ements) or "
"blepharospasm (eyelids are completely closed). Parkinson's disease itself doesn't impair t he intellect, but "
"a coexisting disorder, such as arteriosclerosis, may do so.  "
Myelitis and acute transverse myelitis  
"In acute transverse myelitis, onset is rapid, with motor and sensory dysfunctions below th e level of spinal "
cord damage appearing in 1 to 2 days. Patients with acute transverse myelitis develop flaccid paralysis of 
the legs (sometimes beginning in just one leg) with loss of sensory and sphincter functions. Such sensor y 
loss may follow pain in the legs or trunk. Reflexes disappear in the early stages but may reappear lat er. 
The extent of damage depends on the level of the spinal cord affected; transverse myelitis seldom 
"involves the arms. If spinal cord damage is severe, it may cause shock (hypotension and hypothermia). "
Alzheimer's disease  
"Onset is insidious. Initially, the patient undergoes almost imperceptible changes, such as forgetfulness, "
"recent memory loss, difficulty learning and remembering new information, deterioration in p ersonal "
"hygiene and appearance, and an inability to concentrate. Gradually, tasks that require abstract thinking  "
and activities that require judgment become more difficult. Progressive difficulty in comm unication and 
"severe deterioration in memory, language, and motor function result in a loss of coordinati on and an "
"inability to write or speak. Personality changes (restlessness, irritability) and nocturnal awakeni ngs are "
"common. Patients also exhibit loss of eye contact, a fearful look, wringing of the hand s, and other signs "
"of anxiety. When a patient with Alzheimer's disease is overwhelmed with anxiety, he becomes "
"dysfunctional, acutely confused, agitated, compulsive, or fearful. Eventually, the patient becomes "
"disoriented, and emotional lability and physical and intellectual disability progress. The patient becomes  "
"susceptible to infection and accidents. Usually, death results from infection. "
 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  
"Early signs and symptoms of mental impairment may include slowness in thinking, diffi culty "
"concentrating, impaired judgment, and memory loss. Dementia is progressive and occurs early. "
"Involuntary movements, such as muscle twitching, trembling, and peculiar body moveme nts, and visual "
"disturbances, appear with disease progression and advancing mental deterioration. Hallucinations are "
also common. Duration of the typical illness is 4 months.  
Reye's syndrome  
The severity of the child's signs and symptoms varies with the degree of encephalopathy and cerebral 
"edema. In any case, Reye's syndrome develops in five stages. After the initial viral infection, a brief "
recovery period follows when the child doesn't seem seriously ill. 
"A few days later, he develops intractable vomiting; lethargy; rapidly changing mental status (m ild to "
"severe agitation, confusion, irritability, and delirium); rising blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pu lse "
"rate; and hyperactive reflexes. Reye's syndrome commonly progresses to coma. As coma deepens, "
"seizures develop, followed by decreased tendon reflexes and, usually, respiratory failure. Increased  ICP, "
"a serious complication, is now considered the result of an increased cerebral blood volume causi ng "
"intracranial hypertension. Such swelling may develop as a result of acidosis, increased cerebral metaboli c "
"rate, and an impaired autoregulatory mechanism.  "
Guillain-Barré syndrome  
About 50% of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome have a history of minor febrile illness ( 10 to 14 days 
"before onset), usually an upper respiratory tract infection or, less commonly, gastroenteritis wi th "
"Camphylobacter jejuni. When infection precedes onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome, signs of in fection "
"subside before neurologic features appear. Other possible precipitating factors include surgery,  rabies or "
"swine influenza vaccination, viral illness like Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, and HI V, "
"Hodgkin's or other malignant disease, and lupus erythematosus. Symmetrical muscle weakness, the "
"major neurologic sign, usually appears in the legs first (ascending type) and then extends to the arms and "
"facial nerves in 24 to 72 hours. Sometimes, muscle weakness develops in the arms first (descending type) "
or in the arms and legs simultaneously. (See Testing for thoracic sensation.) In milder forms of this 
"disease, muscle weakness may affect only the cranial nerves or may not occur at all. Another common "
"neurologic sign is paresthesia, which sometimes precedes muscle weakness but tends to vanish quickly. "
"However, some patients with this disorder never develop this symptom. Other clinical feature s may "
"include facial diplegia (possibly with ophthalmoplegia), dysphagia or dysarthria and, less common ly, "
weakness of the muscles supplied by cranial nerve XI. Muscle weakness develops so quickly that muscle 
"atrophy doesn't occur, but hypotonia and areflexia do. Stiffness and pain in the form of a severe “charley "
horse ” commonly occur. 
Myasthenia gravis  
The dominant symptoms of myasthenia gravis are skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. In the e arly 
"stages, easy fatigability of certain muscles may appear with no other findings. Later, it may be severe "
"enough to cause paralysis. Typically, myasthenic muscles are strongest in the morning bu t weaken "
"throughout the day, especially after exercise. Short rest periods temporarily restore muscle functio n. "
"Muscle weakness is progressive; more and more muscles become weak, and eventually so me muscles "
may lose function entirely. Resulting symptoms depend on the muscle group affected; they  become 
"more intense during menses and after emotional stress, prolonged exposure to sunlight or c old, or "
infections.  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  
Progressive loss of muscle strength and coordination eventually interfere with everyday activ ities. 
"Patients with ALS develop fasciculations, accompanied by atrophy and weakness, especially in the "
"muscles of the feet and the hands. Other signs include impaired speech; difficulty chewing, swallo wing, "
"and breathing and, occasionally, choking and excessive drooling. Mental deterioration doesn't occur,  but "
patients may become depressed as a reaction to the disease.  
Multiple sclerosis  
"Clinical findings in MS depend on the extent and site of myelin destruction, the extent of remyel ination, "
and the adequacy of subsequent restored synaptic transmission. Signs and symptoms in MS may be 
"transient, or they may last for hours or weeks. They may wax and wane with no predictable pattern, vary "
"from day to day, and be bizarre and difficult for the patient to describe. In most patients, visual problem s "
"and sensory impairment, such as numbness and tingling sensations (paresthesia), are the first signs th at "
"something may be wrong. Other characteristic changes include: ocular disturbances —optic neuritis, "
"diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, blurred vision, and nystagmus muscle dysfunction —weakness, paralysis "
"ranging from monoplegia to quadriplegia, spasticity, hyperreflexia, intention tremor, and gait atax ia "
"urinary disturbances —incontinence, frequency, urgency, and frequent infections emotional "
"lability —characteristic mood swings, irritability, euphoria, and depression. Associated signs and "
symptoms include poorly articulated or scanning speech and dysphagia. Clinical effects may be so mild 
that the patient is unaware of them or so bizarre that he appears hysterical. 
Trigeminal neuralgia  
"Typically, the patient reports a searing or burning pain that occurs in lightninglike jabs and lasts fr om 1 to "
"15 minutes (usually 1 to 2 minutes) in an area innervated by one of the divisio ns of the trigeminal nerve, "
primarily the superior mandibular or maxillary division. The pain rarely affects more than one divisi on 
and seldom the first division (ophthalmic) or both sides of the face. It affects the second (maxill ary) and 
third (mandibular) divisions of the trigeminal nerve equally.  
Bell's palsy  
"Bell's palsy usually produces unilateral facial weakness, occasionally with aching pain around the angle o f "
"the jaw or behind the ear. On the weak side, the mouth droops (causing the patient to drool saliva from "
"the corner of his mouth), and taste perception is distorted over the affected anterior portion of the "
"tongue. The forehead appears smooth, and the patient's ability to close his eye on the weak side is "
"markedly impaired. When he tries to close this eye, it rolls upward (Bell's phenomenon) and sh ows "
"excessive tearing. Although Bell's phenomenon occurs in normal people, it isn't apparent because the "
"eyelids close completely and cover this eye motion. In Bell's palsy, incomplete ey e closure makes this "
upward motion obvious. Other symptoms may include loss of taste and ringing in the ear.  
Peripheral neuritis  
"The clinical effects of peripheral neuritis develop slowly, and the disease usually affects the motor and "
"sensory nerve fibers. Symptoms vary according to which type of nerve is affected (sensory, motor, or "
autonomic). Neuropathy can affect any one or be a combination of all three types. Sensory  changes: 
"Damage to sensory fibers results in changes in sensation, ranging from abnormal sensations, such as "
"burning, nerve pain, or tingling, to numbness or an inability to determine join t position in the area. "
Sensation changes often begin in the feet and progress toward the center of the body with involvement 
of other areas as the condition worsens. Motor changes: Damage to the motor fibers interferes with 
"muscle control and can cause weakness, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of dexterity. Muscle cramping m ay "
"be a sign of motor nerve involvement. Other muscle-related symptoms include lack o f muscle control, "
"difficulty or inability to move a part of the body (paralysis), muscle atrophy, m uscle twitching "
"(fasciculation) or cramping, difficulty breathing or swallowing, falling (from legs buckling or tripping over "
"toes), or lack of dexterity (such as the inability to button a shirt). Autonomic changes: The au tonomic "
"nerves control involuntary or semivoluntary functions, such as control of internal o rgans and blood "
"pressure. Damage to autonomic nerves can cause blurred vision, decreased ability to sweat (anhi drosis), "
"dizziness that occurs when standing up or fainting associated with a fall in blood pressure, heat "
"intolerance with exertion (decreased ability to regulate body temperature), nausea or vomitin g after "
"meals, abdominal bloating (swelling), feeling full after eating a small amount ( early satiety), diarrhea, "
"constipation, unintentional weight loss (more than 5% of body weight), urinary inco ntinence, feeling of "
"incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate (urinary hesitancy), and  male impotence. "
Complex regional pain syndrome  
Patients usually report severe and constant pain; severe pain is common with CRPS2 in particu lar. The 
"affected area may have altered blood flow, feeling either warm or cool to the touch, with discolorati on, "
"sweating, or swelling. In time, skin, hair, and nail changes may occur along with impaired mob ility and "
"muscle wasting, especially if adequate treatment is delayed.  "
 
Premenstrual syndrome  
Clinical effects vary widely among patients and may include any combination of the 
"following: behavioral —mild to severe personality changes, nervousness, hostility, irritability, "
"agitation, sleep disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and depression somatic —breast tenderness "
"or swelling, abdominal tenderness or bloating, joint pain, headache, edema, diarrhea or "
"constipation, and exacerbations of skin problems (such as acne or rashes), respiratory "
"problems (such as asthma), or neurologic problems (such as seizures). PMS may need to be "
"differentiated from premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which is a more severe form of PMS "
"that's marked by severe depression, irritability, and t ension before menstruation. (See "
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.)  
Dysmenorrhea  
"Dysmenorrhea produces sharp, intermittent, cramping, lower abdominal pain, which usually radiates "
"to the back, thighs, groin, and vulva. Such pain —sometimes compared to lab or pains —typically "
starts with or immediately before menstrual flow and peaks within 24 hours. Dysmenorrhea may 
also be associated with the characteristic signs and symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (urinary 
"frequency, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache,  chills, abdominal bloating, painful breasts, "
"depression, and irritability).  "
Vulvovaginitis  
"In trichomonal vaginitis, vaginal discharge is thin, bubbly, green -tinged, and malodorous. This "
"infection causes marked irritation and itching, and urinary symp toms, such as burning and "
"frequency. Candidal vaginitis produces a thick, white, cottage cheese -like discharge and red, "
"edematous mucous membranes, with white flecks adhering to the vaginal wall, and is often "
"accompanied by intense itching. G. vaginalis pr oduces a gray, foul, “fishy” smelling discharge. Acute "
"vulvitis causes a mild to severe inflammatory reaction, including edema, erythema, burning, and "
pruritus. Severe pain on urination and dyspareunia may necessitate immediate treatment. Herpes 
infection may cause painful ulceration or vesicle formation during the active phase.  
Ovarian cysts  
Small ovarian cysts (such as follicular cysts) usually don't produce symptoms unless torsion or 
"rupture causes signs of an acute abdomen (vomiting, abdominal tende rness, distention, and rigidity). "
"Large or multiple cysts may induce mild pelvic discomfort, low back pain, dyspareunia, or abnormal "
uterine bleeding secondary to a disturbed ovulatory pattern. Ovarian cysts with torsion induce acute 
abdominal pain similar  to that of appendicitis. Granulosa -lutein cysts that appear early in pregnancy 
"may grow as large as 2″ to 2½″ (5 to 6 cm) in diameter and produce unilateral pelvic discomfort and, "
"if rupture occurs, massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. In nonpregnant women , these cysts may "
"cause delayed menses, followed by prolonged or irregular bleeding. Polycystic ovarian disease may "
"also produce secondary amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or infertility.  "
Polycystic ovary syndrome  
"Signs and symptoms of PCOS include mild pel vic discomfort, lower back pain, and dyspareunia "
"caused by multiple ovarian cysts, abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to disturbed ovulatory "
"pattern, hirsutism and male -pattern hair loss that result from abnormal patterns of estrogen "
"secretion, obesity ca used by abnormal hormone regulation, and acne caused by excess sebum "
production that results from disturbed androgen secretion . 
Endometriosis  
"The classic symptom of endometriosis is acquired dysmenorrhea, which may produce constant pain "
"in the lower abd omen and in the vagina, posterior pelvis, and back. This pain usually begins from 5 "
to 7 days before menses reaches its peak and lasts for 2 to 3 days. It differs from primary 
"dysmenorrheal pain, which is more cramplike and concentrated in the abdominal mi dline. However, "
the pain's severity doesn't necessarily indicate the extent of the disease. Other clinical features 
depend on the location of the ectopic tissue: ovaries and oviducts: infertility and profuse menses 
"ovaries or cul -de-sac: deep -thrust dyspar eunia bladder: suprapubic pain, dysuria, hematuria small "
"bowel and appendix: nausea and vomiting, which worsen before menses, and abdominal cramps "
"cervix, vagina, and perineum: bleeding from endometrial deposits in these areas during menses. The "
primary co mplications of endometriosis are infertility and chronic pelvic pain.  
Uterine leiomyomas  
Leiomyomas may be located within the uterine wall or may protrude into the endometrial cavity or 
from the serosal surface of the uterus. Most leiomyomas produce no  symptoms. The most common 
"symptom is abnormal bleeding, which typically presents clinically as menorrhagia. Uterine "
leiomyomas probably don't cause pain directly except when associated with torsion of a 
pedunculated subserous tumor. Pelvic pressure and im pingement on adjacent viscera are common 
"indications for treatment. Other symptoms may include urinary retention, constipation, or "
dyspareunia.  
Precocious puberty  
"The usual pattern of precocious puberty in females is a rapid growth spurt, thelarche (breast "
"development), pubarche (pubic hair development), and menarche —all before age 9. These changes "
may occur independently or simultaneously.  
Menopause  
Many menopausal women are asymptomatic but some have severe symptoms. The declin e in 
ovarian function and consequent decreased estrogen level produce menstrual irregularities: a 
"decrease in the amount and duration of menstrual flow, spotting, and episodes of amenorrhea and "
polymenorrhea (possibly with hypermenorrhea). Irregularities m ay last a few months or persist for 
several years before menstruation ceases permanently. The following body system changes may 
occur (usually after the permanent cessation of menstruation): Reproductive system: Menopause 
"may cause shrinkage of vulval stru ctures and loss of subcutaneous fat, possibly leading to atrophic "
"vulvitis; atrophy of vaginal mucosa and flattening of vaginal rugae, possibly causing bleeding after "
coitus or douching; vaginal itching and discharge from bacterial invasion; and loss of ca pillaries in the 
"atrophying vaginal wall, causing the pink, rugal lining to become smooth and white. Menopause may "
also produce excessive vaginal dryness and dyspareunia due to decreased lubrication from the 
vaginal walls and decreased secretion from Barth olin's glands; smaller ovaries and oviducts; and 
progressive pelvic relaxation as the supporting structures lose their tone due to the absence of 
"estrogen. ELDER TIP As a woman ages, atrophy causes the vagina to shorten and the mucous lining "
"to become thin , dry, less elastic, and pale as a result of decreased vascularity. In addition, the pH of "
"vaginal secretions increases, making the P 0 vaginal environment more alkaline. The type of flora "
"also changes, increasing the older woman's chance of vaginal infect ions. Urinary system: Atrophic "
cystitis due to the effects of decreased estrogen levels on bladder mucosa and related structures 
"may cause pyuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. Urethral carbuncles "
"from loss of urethral tone and  mucosal thinning may cause dysuria, meatal tenderness, and "
hematuria. Mammary system: Breast size decreases. Integumentary system: The patient may 
"experience loss of skin elasticity and turgor due to estrogen deprivation, loss of pubic and axillary "
"hair a nd, occasionally, slight alopecia. Autonomic nervous system: The patient may exhibit hot "
"flashes and night sweats (in 75% of women), vertigo, syncope, tachycardia, dyspnea, tinnitus, "
"emotional disturbances (irritability, nervousness, crying spells, fits of  anger), and exacerbation of "
"pre-existing depression, anxiety, and compulsive, manic, or schizoid behavior. Menopause may also "
"induce atherosclerosis, and a decrease in estrogen level contributes to osteoporosis. Ovarian activity "
"in younger women is believ ed to provide a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, and the "
loss of this function at menopause may partly explain the increased death rate from myocardial 
"infarction in older women. Also, estrogen has been found to increase levels of high -densi ty "
lipoprotein cholesterol.  
Female infertility  
Pelvic inflammatory disease  
"Clinical features of PID vary with the affected area but generally include a profuse, purulent vaginal "
"discharge, sometimes accompanied by lowgrade fever and malaise (particu larly if gonorrhea is the "
cause). The patient experiences lower abdomen pain; movement of the cervix or palpation of the 
"adnexa may be extremely painful. Frequent, painful urination is also commonly reported. Additional "
"signs and symptoms include irregular  or absent menstruation, dyspareunia, low back pain, and "
nausea and vomiting.  
Amenorrhea  
Secondary amenorrhea can be diagnosed when a change is noted in a previously established 
menstrual pattern (absence of menstruation for 3 months). A thorough physi cal and pelvic 
"examination rules out pregnancy, as well as anatomic abnormalities such as cervical stenosis that "
"may cause false amenorrhea (cryptomenorrhea), in which menstruation occurs without external "
"bleeding. Onset of menstruation within 1 week after  administration of pure progestational agents, "
"such as medroxyprogesterone and progesterone, indicates a functioning uterus. If menstruation "
"doesn't occur, special diagnostic studies are appropriate. Blood and urine studies may reveal "
"hormonal imbalances, such as lack of ovarian response to gonadotropins (elevated pituitary "
"gonadotropins), failure of gonadotropin secretion (low pituitary gonadotropin levels), and abnormal "
thyroid levels. Tests for identification of dominant or missing hormones include cervi cal mucus 
"ferning, vaginal cytologic examinations, basal body temperature, endometrial biopsy (during "
"dilatation and curettage), urinary 17 -ketosteroids, and plasma progesterone, testosterone, and "
"androgen levels. A complete medical workup, including X -rays, laparoscopy, and a biopsy, may "
"detect ovarian, adrenal, and pituitary tumors.  "
Abnormal premenopausal bleeding  
"Bleeding not associated with abnormal pregnancy is usually painless, but it may be severely painful. "
"When bleeding is associated with abnor mal pregnancy, other symptoms include nausea, breast "
"tenderness, bloating, and fluid retention. Severe or prolonged bleeding causes anemia, especially in "
patients with underlying disease such as blood dyscrasia and in patients receiving anticoagulants.  
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding  
DUB usually occurs as metrorrhagia (episodes of vaginal bleeding between menses); it may also 
"occur as hypermenorrhea (heavy or prolonged menses, longer than 8 days) or chronic "
polymenorrhea (menstrual cycle of less than 18 days). Such bleeding is unpredictable and can cause 
anemia.  
Postmenopausal bleeding  
"Vaginal bleeding, the primary symptom, ranges from spotting to outright hemorrhage; its duration "
"also varies. Other symptoms depend on the cause. Excessive estrogen sti mulation, for example, may "
also produce copious cervical mucus; estrogen deficiency may cause vaginal mucosa to atrophy.  
Abortion  
Prodromal signs of spontaneous abortion may include a pink discharge for several days or a scant 
brown discharge for several weeks before the onset of cramps and increased vaginal bleeding. For a 
"few hours, the cramps intensify and occur more frequently; then the cervix dilates to expel uterine "
"contents. If the entire conte nts are expelled, cramps and bleeding subside. However, if any contents "
"remain, cramps and bleeding continue.  "
Ectopic pregnancy  
Ectopic pregnancy sometimes produces symptoms of normal pregnancy or no symptoms other than 
"mild abdominal pain, making diag nosis difficult. Characteristic clinical effects after fallopian tube "
"implantation include amenorrhea or abnormal menses, followed by slight vaginal bleeding, and "
"unilateral pelvic pain over the mass. Rupture of the tube causes life -threatening complicatio ns, "
"including hemorrhage, shock, and peritonitis. The patient experiences sharp lower abdominal pain, "
"possibly radiating to the shoulders and neck, often precipitated by activities that increase abdominal "
"pressure, such as a bowel movement; she feels extre me pain upon motion of the cervix and "
palpation of the adnexa during a pelvic examination.  
Hyperemesis gravidarum  
The cardinal symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum are unremitting nausea and vomiting. The 
"vomitus initially contains undigested food and mu cus as well as small amounts of bile; later, only bile "
"and mucus; and finally, blood and material that resembles coffee grounds. Persistent vomiting "
"causes substantial weight loss and eventual emaciation. Associated effects may include pale, dry, "
"waxy, and  possibly jaundiced skin; subnormal or elevated temperature; rapid pulse; a fetid, fruity "
"breath odor from acidosis; and central nervous system symptoms, such as confusion, delirium, "
"headache, lassitude, stupor and, possibly, coma.  "
Gestational hypertensi on 
"Mild preeclampsia generally produces the following clinical effects: hypertension, proteinuria (less "
"than 5 g/24 hours), generalized edema, and sudden weight gain of more than 3 lb (1.4 kg) per week "
during the second trimester or more than 1 lb (0.5 k g) a week during the third trimester. Severe 
"preeclampsia is marked by increased hypertension and proteinuria, eventually leading to the "
"development of oliguria. Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (the HELLP P 7 "
syndrome) is a severe vari ant. Other symptoms that may indicate worsening preeclampsia include 
"blurred vision due to retinal arteriolar spasms, epigastric pain or heartburn, and severe frontal "
"headache. In eclampsia, all the clinical manifestations of preeclampsia are magnified and  are "
"associated with seizures and, possibly, coma, premature labor, stillbirth, renal failure, and hepatic "
damage.  
 
Hydatidiform mole  
"The early stages of a pregnancy in which a hydatidiform mole develops typically seem normal, "
except that the uterus may  grow more rapidly than usual. The first obvious signs of trouble —
"absence of fetal heart tones, vaginal bleeding (from spotting to hemorrhage), and lower abdominal "
cramps —mimic those of spontaneous abortion. The blood may contain hydatid vesicles; 
"hypereme sis is possible, and signs and symptoms of preeclampsia are also possible. Other "
"complications of P 9 hydatidiform mole may include anemia, infection, trophoblast embolism, "
"uterine rupture, and choriocarcinoma.  "
Placenta previa  
Placenta previa usually p roduces painless third -trimester bleeding (often the first complaint). 
Various malpresentations occur because of the placenta's location and interfere with proper descent 
"of the fetal head. P 0 (The fetus remains active, however, with good heart tones.) Co mplications of "
placenta previa include shock or maternal and fetal death.  
Abruptio placentae  
"Abruptio placentae produces a wide range of clinical effects, depending on the extent of placental "
separation and the amount of blood lost from maternal circul ation. (See Degrees of placental 
"separation in abruptio placentae, page 1192.) Mild abruptio placentae (marginal separation) "
"develops gradually and produces mild to moderate bleeding, vague lower abdominal discomfort, "
"mild to moderate abdominal tenderness,  and uterine irritability. Fetal heart tones remain strong and "
regular. Moderate abruptio placentae (about 50% placental separation) may develop gradually or 
"abruptly and produces continuous abdominal pain, moderate dark red vaginal bleeding, a tender "
"uter us that remains firm between contractions, barely audible or irregular and bradycardiac fetal "
"heart tones and, possibly, signs of shock. Labor usually starts within 2 hours and often proceeds "
rapidly.  
Cardiovascular disease in pregnancy  
"Typical clinical features of cardiovascular disease during pregnancy include distended jugular veins, "
"diastolic murmurs, moist basilar pulmonary crackles, cardiac enlargement (discernible on percussion "
"or as a cardiac shadow on chest X -ray), and cardiac ar rhythmias (other than sinus or paroxysmal "
"atrial tachycardia). Other characteristic abnormalities may include cyanosis, pericardial friction rub, "
"pulse delay, and pulsus alternans. P 4 Decompensation may develop suddenly or gradually, with "
"persistent crack les at the lung bases. As it progresses, edema, increasing dyspnea on exertion, "
"palpitations, a smothering sensation, and hemoptysis may occur.  "
Adolescent pregnancy  
Clinical manifestations of adolescent pregnancy are the same as those of adult pregnanc y 
"(amenorrhea, nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, fatigue). However, the pregnant adolescent is "
"much more likely to develop complications, such as poor weight gain during pregnancy, premature "
"labor, and pregnancy -induced hypertension. In addition, the ne onate is more likely to be of low birth "
"weight. Some of these complications are related to the pregnant adolescent's physical immaturity, "
"rapid growth, interest in fad diets, and generally poor nutrition; other complications may stem from "
"the adolescent's need to deny her condition or to her ignorance of early signs of pregnancy, which "
often delays initiation of prenatal care.  
 
Diabetic complications during pregnancy  
"Indications for diagnostic screening for maternal diabetes mellitus during pregnancy inc lude obesity, "
"excessive weight gain, excessive hunger or thirst, polyuria, recurrent monilial infections, glycosuria, "
"previous delivery of a large neonate, polyhydramnios, maternal hypertension, and a family history of "
diabetes.  
Preterm labor  
"Like labo r at term, preterm labor produces rhythmic uterine contractions, cervical dilation and "
"effacement, possible rupture of the membranes, expulsion of the cervical mucus plug, and a bloody "
discharge.  
Premature rupture of membranes  
"Typically, PROM causes bl ood-tinged amniotic fluid containing vernix particles to gush or leak from "
"the vagina. Maternal fever, fetal tachycardia, and foulsmelling vaginal discharge indicate infection.  "
Puerperal infection  
A characteristic sign of puerperal infection is fever (at least 100.4° F [38° C]) that occurs in the first 
24 hours in the first 9 days postpartum. This fever can spike as high as 105° F (40.6° C) and is 
"commonly associated with chills, headache, malaise, restlessness, and anxiety. Abortion or "
miscarriage isn 't usually associated with this infection and fever. Accompanying signs and symptoms 
"depend on the infection's extent and site and may include: endometritis: heavy, sometimes foul -"
"smelling lochia; tender, enlarged uterus; backache; severe uterine contracti ons persisting after "
childbirth parametritis (pelvic cellulitis): vaginal tenderness and abdominal pain and tenderness 
"(pain may become more intense as infection spreads). The inflammation may remain localized, may "
"lead to abscess formation, or may spread through the blood or lymphatic system. Widespread "
"inflammation may cause: pelvic thrombophlebitis: severe, repeated chills and dramatic swings in "
"body temperature; lower abdominal or flank pain; and, possibly, a palpable tender mass over the "
"affected area,  which usually develops near the second postpartum week femoral thrombophlebitis: "
"pain, stiffness, or swelling in a leg or the groin; inflammation or shiny, white appearance of the "
"affected leg; malaise; fever; and chills, usually beginning 10 to 20 days p ostpartum (these signs may "
"precipitate pulmonary embolism) peritonitis: body temperature usually elevated, accompanied by "
"tachycardia (greater than 140 beats/minute), weak pulse, hiccups, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; "
constant and possibly excruciating a bdominal pain.  
Mastitis and breast engorgement  
Mastitis may develop anytime during lactation but usually begins 1 to 2 weeks postpartum with 
"fever (101° F [38.3° C] or higher in acute mastitis), malaise, and flulike symptoms. The breast (or, "
"occasional ly, both breasts) becomes tender, hard, swollen, and warm. Unless mastitis is treated "
"adequately, it may progress to breast abscess. Breast engorgement generally starts with onset of "
"lactation (day 2 to day 5 postpartum). The breasts undergo changes simila r to those in mastitis, and "
"body temperature may be elevated. Engorgement may be mild, causing only slight discomfort, or "
"severe, causing considerable pain. A severely engorged breast can interfere with the infant's "
"capacity to feed because of his inabilit y to position his mouth properly on the swollen, rigid breast.  "
Galactorrhea  
"In the female with galactorrhea, milk continues to flow after the 21 -day period that's normal after "
"weaning. Galactorrhea may also be spontaneous and unrelated to normal lactation, or it may be "
caused by manual expression. Such abnormal flow is usually bilateral and may be accompanied by 
amenorrhea . 
Hyperbilirubinemia  
"The primary sign of hyperbilirubinemia is jaundice, which doesn't b ecome clinically apparent until "
serum bilirubin levels reach about 7 mg/dl. Physiologic jaundice develops 24 hours after delivery in 
50% of term neonates (usually day 2 to day 3) and 48 hours after delivery in 80% of premature 
neonates (usually day 3 to da y 5). It generally disappears by day 7 in term neonates and by day 10 in 
"premature neonates. Throughout physiologic jaundice, serum unconjugated bilirubin levels don't "
exceed 12 mg/dl. Pathologic jaundice may appear anytime after the first day of life and persists 
"beyond 7 days with serum bilirubin levels greater than 12 mg/dl in a term neonate, 15 mg/dl in a "
"premature neonate, or increasing more than 5 mg/dl in 24 hours.  "
Erythroblastosis fetalis  
Jaundice usually isn't present at birth but may appear as  soon as 30 minutes later or within 24 hours. 
The mildly affected neonate shows mild to moderate hepatosplenomegaly and pallor. In severely 
"affected neonates who survive birth, erythroblastosis fetalis usually produces pallor, edema, "
"petechiae, hepatosplen omegaly, grunting respirations, pulmonary crackles, poor muscle tone, "
"neurologic unresponsiveness, possible heart murmurs, a bilestained umbilical cord, and yellow or "
meconium -stained amniotic fluid. About 10% of untreated neonates develop kernicterus from  
"hemolytic disease and show symptoms such as anemia, lethargy, poor sucking ability, retracted "
"head, stiff limbs, squinting, a high -pitched cry, and seizures. Hydrops fetalis causes extreme "
"hemolysis, fetal hypoxia, heart failure (with possible pericardial  effusion and circulatory collapse), "
"edema (ranging from mild peripheral edema to anasarca), peritoneal and pleural effusions (with "
"dyspnea and pulmonary crackles), and green - or browntinged amniotic fluid (usually indicating a "
stillbirth). Other distincti ve characteristics of the neonate with hydrops fetalis include enlarged 
"placenta, marked pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, and ascites. Petechiae and widespread "
"ecchymoses are present in severe cases, indicating concurrent disseminated intravascula r "

Respiratory distress syndrome  
"Although a neonate with RDS may breathe normally at first, he usually develops rapid, shallow "
"respirations within minutes or hours of birth, with intercostal, subcostal, or sternal retractions; nasal "
flaring; and aud ible expiratory grunting. This grunting is a natural compensatory mechanism 
designed to produce positive end -expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prevent further alveolar collapse. 
"Severe disease is marked by apnea, bradycardia, and cyanosis (from hypoxemia, lef t-to-right "
"shunting through the foramen ovale, or right -toleft intrapulmonary shunting through atelectatic "
"regions of the lung). Other clinical features include pallor, frothy sputum, and low body temperature "
as a result of an immature nervous system and the absence of subcutaneous fat.  
 
Sudden infant death syndrome  
Although parents find some victims wedged in crib corners or with blankets wrapped around their 
"heads, autopsies rule out suffocation as the cause of death. Autopsy shows a patent airway, so  "
"aspiration of vomitus isn't the cause of death. Typically, SIDS babies don't cry out and show no signs "
"of having been disturbed in their sleep. However, their positions or tangled blankets may suggest "
"movement just before death, perhaps due to terminal sp asm. Depending on how long the infant has "
"been dead, a SIDS baby may have a mottled complexion with extreme cyanosis of the lips and "
fingertips or pooling of blood in the legs and feet that may be mistaken for bruises. Pulse and 
"respirations are absent, an d the diaper is wet and full of stool.  "
 
Croup  
The onset of croup usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Clinical features include 
"inspiratory stridor, hoarse or muffled vocal sounds, varying degrees of laryngeal obstruction and "
"respirator y distress, and a characteristic sharp, barking, seal -like cough. These symptoms may last "
"only a few hours or persist for a day or two. As it progresses, croup causes inflammatory edema and, "
"possibly, spasm, which can obstruct the upper airway and severely  compromise ventilation. (See "
How croup affects the upper airway.) Each form of croup has additional characteristics: In 
"laryngotracheobronchitis, the symptoms seem to worsen at night. Inflammation causes edema of "
the bronchi and bronchioles as well as inc reasingly difficult expiration that frightens the child. Other 
"characteristic features include fever, diffusely decreased breath sounds, expiratory rhonchi, and "
"scattered crackles. Laryngitis, which results from vocal cord edema, is usually mild and produc es no "
"respiratory distress except in infants. Early signs include a sore throat and cough, which, rarely, may "
"progress to marked hoarseness, suprasternal and intercostal retractions, inspiratory stridor, "
"dyspnea, P diminished breath sounds, restlessness an d, in later stages, severe dyspnea and "
"exhaustion. Acute spasmodic laryngitis affects a child between ages 1 and 3, particularly one with "
allergies and a family history of croup. It typically begins with mild to moderate hoarseness and nasal 
"discharge, fol lowed by the characteristic cough and noisy inspiration (that usually awaken the child "
"at night), labored breathing with retractions, rapid pulse, and clammy skin. The child understandably "
"becomes anxious, which may lead to increasing dyspnea and transient  cyanosis. These severe "
symptoms diminish after several hours but reappear in a milder form on the next one or two nights.  
 
 
Epiglottiditis  
"Sometimes preceded by an upper respiratory infection, epiglottiditis may rapidly progress to "
complete upper airway  obstruction within 2 to 5 hours. Laryngeal obstruction results from 
"inflammation and edema of the epiglottis. Accompanying symptoms include high fever, stridor, sore "
"throat, dysphagia, irritability, restlessness, and drooling. To relieve severe respirator y distress, the "
"child with epiglottiditis may hyperextend his neck, sit up, and lean forward with his mouth open, "
"tongue protruding, and nostrils flaring as he tries to breathe. He may develop inspiratory retractions "
and rhonchi.  
Acute respiratory distre ss syndrome  
"ARDS initially produces rapid, shallow breathing and dyspnea within hours to days of the initial injury "
"(sometimes after the patient's condition appears to have stabilized). Hypoxemia develops, causing "
"an increased drive for ventilation. Beca use of the effort required to expand the stiff lung, intercostal "
and suprasternal retractions result. Fluid accumulation produces crackles and rhonchi; worsening 
"hypoxemia causes restlessness, apprehension, mental sluggishness, motor dysfunction, and "
tachy cardia (possibly with transient increased arterial blood pressure). Severe ARDS causes 
"overwhelming hypoxemia. If uncorrecte d, this results in hypotension, decreasing urine output, "
"respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and eventually ventricular fibrillation or standstill.  ELDER TIP The "
older patient may appear to do well following an initial episode of ARDS. Symptoms commonly 
appear 2 to 3 days later.  
Acute respiratory failure in COPD  
"In patients who have COPD with ARF, increased ventilation -perfusion mi smatch and reduced "
alveolar ventilation decrease PaO2 (hypoxemia) and increase PaCO2 (hypercapnia). This rise in 
"carbon dioxide (CO2 ) lowers the pH. The resulting hypoxemia and acidemia affect all body organs, "
especially the CNS and the respiratory and ca rdiovascular systems. Specific symptoms vary with the 
"underlying cause of ARF but may include these systems: Respiratory —Rate may be increased, "
"decreased, or normal depending on the cause; respirations may be shallow, deep, or alternate "
"between the two; an d air hunger may occur. Cyanosis may or may not be present, depending on the "
"hemoglobin (Hb) level and arterial oxygenation. Auscultation of the chest may reveal crackles, "
"rhonchi, wheezing, or diminished breath sounds. CNS —When hypoxemia and hypercapnia o ccur, the "
"patient may show evidence of restlessness, confusion, loss of concentration, irritability, "
"tremulousness, diminished tendon reflexes, and papilledema; he may slip into a coma. "
"Cardiovascular —Tachycardia, with increased cardiac output and mildly e levated blood pressure "
"secondary to adrenal release of catecholamine, occurs early in response to low PaO2 . With "
"myocardial hypoxia, arrhythmias may develop. Pulmonary hypertension, secondary to pulmonary "
"capillary vasoconstriction, may cause increased pr essures on the right side of the heart, elevated "
"jugular veins, an enlarged liver, and peripheral edema. Stresses on the heart may precipitate cardiac "
failure.  
Pulmonary edema  
The early symptoms of pulmonary edema reflect interstitial fluid accumulatio n and diminished lung 
"compliance: dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and coughing. Clinical "
"features include tachycardia, tachypnea, dependent crackles, jugular vein distention, and a diastolic "
"(S3 ) gallop. With severe pulmonary  edema, the alveoli and bronchioles may fill with fluid and "
"intensify the early symptoms. Respiration becomes labored and rapid, with more diffuse crackles "
"and coughing that produces frothy, bloody sputum. Tachycardia increases, and arrhythmias may "
"occur. Skin becomes cold, clammy, diaphoretic, and cyanotic. Blood pressure falls and the pulse "
becomes thready as cardiac output falls. Symptoms of severe heart failure with pulmonary edema 
"may also include signs of hypoxemia, such as anxiety, restlessness, and changes in the patient's level "
of consciousness.  
 
Cor pulmonale  
"As long as the heart can compensate for the increased pulmonary vascular resistance, clinical "
features reflect the underlying disorder and occur mostly in the respiratory system. They include 
"chronic productive cough, exertional dyspnea, wheezing respirations, fatigue, and weakness. "
"Progression of cor pulmonale is associated with dyspnea (even at rest) that worsens on exertion, "
"tachypnea, orthopnea , edema, weakness, and right upper quadrant discomfort. Chest examination "
reveals findings characteristic of the underlying lung disease. Signs of cor pulmonale and right -sided 
heart failure include dependent edema; distended jugular veins; prominent paras ternal or epigastric 
"cardiac impulse; hepatojugular reflux; an enlarged, tender liver; ascites; and tachycardia. Decreased "
"cardiac output may cause a weak pulse and hypotension. Chest examination yields various findings, "
"depending on the underlying cause o f cor pulmonale. In COPD, auscultation reveals wheezing, "
"rhonchi, and diminished breath sounds. When the disease is secondary to upper airway obstruction "
"or damage to central nervous system respiratory centers, chest findings may be normal, except for a "
"right ventricular lift, gallop rhythm, and loud pulmonic component of S2. Tricuspid insufficiency "
produces a pansystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border; its intensity increases on 
"inspiration, distinguishing it from a murmur due to mitral valv e disease. A right ventricular early "
murmur that increases on inspiration can be heard at the left sternal border or over the epigastrium. 
A systolic pulmonic ejection click may also be heard. Alterations in the patient's level of 
consciousness may occur.  
 
Legionnaires' disease  
"The multisystem clinical features of Legionnaires' disease follow a predictable sequence, although "
"the onset of the disease may be gradual or sudden. After a 2 - to 10 -day incubation period, "
"nonspecific, pro dromal signs and symptoms appear, including diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, diffuse "
"myalgias and generalized weakness, headache, and recurrent chills. An unremitting fever develops "
within 12 to 48 hours with a temperature that may reach 105° F (40.6° C). A co ugh then develops 
"that's nonproductive initially but eventually may produce grayish, nonpurulent, and occasionally "
"blood -streaked sputum. Other characteristic features include nausea, vomiting, disorientation, "
"mental sluggishness, confusion, mild temporary  amnesia, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, "
and fine crackles. Patients who develop pneumonia may also experience hypoxia. Other 
"complications include hypotension, delirium, heart failure, arrhythmias, acute respiratory failure, "
"renal failure, and shock (usually fatal)  "
Atelectasis  
"Clinical effects vary with the cause of collapse, the degree of hypoxemia, and any underlying disease "
but generally include some degree of dyspnea. Atelectasis of a small area of the lung may produce 
"only minimal sympt oms that subside without specific treatment. However, massive collapse can "
"produce severe dyspnea, anxiety, cyanosis, diaphoresis, peripheral circulatory collapse, tachycardia, "
"and substernal or intercostal retraction. Also, atelectasis may result in compe nsatory hyperinflation "
"of unaffected areas of the lung, mediastinal shift to the affected side, and elevation of the ipsilateral "
hemidiaphragm.  
 
Respiratory acidosis  
Acute respiratory acidosis produces CNS disturbances that reflect changes in the pH of cerebrospinal 
"fluid rather than increased CO2 levels in cerebral circulation. Effects range from restlessness, "
"confusion, and apprehension to somnolence, with a fine or flapping tremor (asterixis), or coma. The "
patient may complain of headaches as well as exhibit dyspnea and tachypnea with papilledema and 
"depressed reflexes. Unless the patient is P receiving O2 , hypoxemia accompanies respiratory "
"acidosis. This disorder may also cause cardiovascular abnormalities, such as tachycardia, "
"hypertension, atrial a nd ventricular arrhythmias and, in severe acidosis, hypotension with "
vasodilation (bounding pulses and warm periphery).  
 
Respiratory alkalosis  
"The cardinal sign of respiratory alkalosis is deep, rapid breathing, possibly exceeding 40 "
breaths/minute. Thi s pattern of breathing is similar to Kussmaul's respirations that characterize 
"diabetic acidosis. Such hyperventilation usually leads to CNS and neuromuscular disturbances, such "
"as light -headedness or dizziness (due to below -normal CO2 levels that decrease  cerebral blood flow), "
"agitation, circumoral and peripheral paresthesias, carpopedal spasms, twitching (possibly "
"progressing to tetany), and muscle weakness. Severe respiratory alkalosis may cause cardiac "
"arrhythmias (that may fail to respond to convention al treatment), seizures, or both.  "
Pneumothorax  
"The cardinal features of pneumothorax are sudden, sharp, pleuritic pain (exacerbated by movement "
"of the chest, breathing, and coughing); asymmetrical chest wall movement; and shortness of breath. "
"Additiona l signs of tension pneumothorax are weak and rapid pulse, pallor, jugular vein distention, "
and anxiety. Tracheal deviations may be present with mediastinal shift. Tension pneumothorax 
produces the most severe respiratory symptoms; a spontaneous pneumothora x that releases only a 
"small amount of air into the pleural space may cause no symptoms. In a nontension pneumothorax, "
the severity of symptoms is usually related to the size of the pneumothorax and the degree of 
preexisting respiratory disease.  
Pneumoni a 
"The main symptoms of pneumonia are coughing, sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, shaking "
"chills, shortness of breath, rapid shallow breathing, and fever. Physical signs vary widely, ranging "
"from diffuse, fine crackles to signs of localized or extensive consolidation and pleural effusion. There "
"may also be associated symptoms of headache, sweating, loss of appetite, excess fatigue, and "
"confusion (in older people). Complications include hypoxemia, r espiratory failure, pleural effusion, "
"empyema, lung abscess, and bacteremia, with spread of infection to other parts of the body, "
"resulting in meningitis, endocarditis, and pericarditis.  "
Idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia  
"The presenting symptoms of BOOP are usually subacute, with a flulike syndrome of fever, persistent "
"and nonproductive cough, dyspnea (especially with exertion), malaise, anorexia, and weight loss "
lasting for several weeks to several months. Physical assessment  findings may reveal dry crackles as 
"the only abnormality. Less common symptoms include a productive cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, "
"generalized aching, and night sweats.  "
Pulmonary embolism  
Total occlusion of the main pulmonary artery is rapidly fatal; smaller or fragmented emboli produce 
"symptoms that vary with the size, number, and location of the emboli. Usually, the first symptom of "
"pulmonary embolism is dyspnea, which may be accompanied by anginal or pleuritic chest pain. "
"Other clinical features inc lude tachycardia, productive cough (sputum may be blood -tinged), low -"
"grade fever, and pleural effusion. Less common signs include massive hemoptysis, chest splinting, "
"leg edema and, with a large embolus, cyanosis, syncope, and distended jugular veins. In a ddition, "
"pulmonary embolism may cause pleural friction rub and signs of circulatory collapse (weak, rapid "
pulse and hypotension) and hypoxia P (restlessness and anxiety).  
Sarcoidosis  
"Initial symptoms of sarcoidosis include arthralgia (in the wrists, an kles, and elbows), fatigue, malaise, "
and weight loss. Other clinical features vary according to the extent and location of the fibrosis: 
"Respiratory —breathlessness, cough (usually nonproductive), substernal pain; complications in "
advanced pulmonary disease  include pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale Cutaneous —
"erythema nodosum, subcutaneous skin nodules with maculopapular eruptions, and extensive nasal "
"mucosal lesions Ophthalmic —anterior uveitis (common), glaucoma, and blindness (rare) "
Lymphatic —bilater al hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly P 
"Musculoskeletal —muscle weakness, polyarthralgia, pain, and punched -out lesions on phalanges "
"Hepatic —granulomatous hepatitis, usually asymptomatic Genitourinary —hypercalciuria "
"Cardiovascular —arrhythmias (premature beats, bundle -branch or complete heart block) and, rarely, "
"cardiomyopathy Central nervous system —cranial or peripheral nerve palsies, basilar meningitis, "
"seizures, and pituitary and hypothalamic lesions producing diabetes insipidus.  "
Severe acute respiratory syndrome  
The incubation period for SARS is typically 3 to 5 days but may last as long as 14 days. Initial signs 
"and symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and other minor respiratory symptoms, general "
"discomfort, headache , rigors, chills, myalgia, sore throat, and dry cough. Some individuals may "
"develop diarrhea or a rash. Later complications include respiratory failure, liver failure, heart failure, "
"myelodysplastic syndromes, and death  "
Lung abscess  
"The clinical effect s of lung abscess include a cough that may produce bloody, purulent, or foul -"
"smelling sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, excessive sweating, chills, fever, headache, malaise, "
"diaphoresis, and weight loss. Chronic lung abscess may cause localized bronch iectasis. Failure of an "
abscess to improve with antibiotic treatment suggests possible underlying neoplasm or other causes 
of obstruction.  
Hemothorax  
"The patient with hemothorax may experience chest pain, tachypnea, and mild to severe dyspnea, "
dependin g on the amount of blood in the pleural cavity and associated pathologic conditions. If 
"respiratory failure results, the patient may appear anxious, restless, possibly stuporous, and "
cyanotic; marked blood loss produces hypotension and shock. The affected side of the chest expands 
"and stiffens, whereas the unaffected side rises and falls with the patient's breaths.  "
Pulmonary hypertension  
"Most patients complain of increasing dyspnea on exertion, weakness, syncope, and fatigability. "
"Many also show signs o f right -sided heart failure, including peripheral edema, ascites, jugular vein "
"distention, and hepatomegaly. Other clinical effects vary with the underlying disorder.  "
Pleural effusion and empyema  
Patients with pleural effusion characteristically display symptoms relating to the underlying 
"pathologic condition. Most patients with large effusions, particularly those with underlying "
"pulmonary disease, complain of dyspnea. Those with effusions associat ed with pleurisy complain of "
pleuritic chest pain. Other clinical features depend on the cause of the effusion. Patients with 
empyema also develop fever and malaise.  
Pleurisy  
"Sharp, stabbing pain that increases with deep breathing may be so severe that  it limits movement on "
the affected side. Dyspnea also occurs. Other symptoms vary according to the underlying pathologic 
process.  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
"The typical patient, a long -term cigarette smoker, has no symptoms until middle age . His ability to "
"exercise or do strenuous work gradually starts to decline, and he begins to develop a productive "
cough. These signs are subtle at first but become more pronounced as the patient gets older and the 
"disease progresses. Eventually the patient  may develop dyspnea on minimal exertion, frequent "
"respiratory infections, intermittent or continuous hypoxemia, and grossly abnormal pulmonary "
"function studies. Advanced COPD may cause severe dyspnea, overwhelming disability, cor "
"pulmonale, severe respira tory failure, and death.  "
Bronchiectasis  
"Initially, bronchiectasis may be asymptomatic. When symptoms do arise, they're commonly "
attributed to other illnesses. The patient usually P complains of frequent bouts of pneumonia or 
"hemoptysis. The classic sym ptom, however, is a chronic cough that produces foul -smelling, "
mucopurulent secretions in amounts ranging from less than 10 ml/day to more than 150 ml/day. 
Cough and sputum production are observed in greater than 90% of bronchiectasis patients. 
"Characteris tic findings include coarse crackles during inspiration over involved lobes or segments, "
"occasional wheezing, dyspnea, sinusitis, weight loss, anemia, malaise, clubbing, recurrent fever, "
"chills, and other signs of infection.  "
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  
"The usual presenting symptoms of IPF are dyspnea and a dry, hacking, and typically paroxysmal "
cough. Most patients have had these symptoms for several months to 2 years before seeking 
"medical help. End -expiratory crackles, especially in the bases of the  lungs, are usually heard early in "
"the disease. Bronchial breath sounds appear later, when airway consolidation develops. Rapid, "
"shallow breathing occurs, especially with exertion, and clubbing has been noted in more than 40% of "
"patients. Late in the disea se, cyanosis and evidence of pulmonary hypertension (augmented S2 and "
"S3 gallop) commonly occur. As the disease progresses, profound hypoxemia and severe, debilitating "
dyspnea are the hallmark signs.  
Tuberculosis  
"After an incubation period of 4 to 8 we eks, TB is usually asymptomatic in primary infection but may "
"produce nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, night sweats, and "
"low-grade fever. ELDER TIP Fever and night sweats, the typical hallmarks of TB, may not be presen t "
"in elderly patients, who instead may exhibit a change in activity or weight. Assess older patients "
"carefully. In reactivation, symptoms may include a cough that produces mucopurulent sputum, "
"occasional hemoptysis, and chest pains.  "
Silicosis  
"Initially, silicosis may be asymptomatic or may produce dyspnea on exertion, usually attributed to "
being “out of shape” or “slowing down.” If the disease progresses to the chronic and complicated 
"stage, dyspnea on exertion worsens, and other symptoms —usually tachypnea and an insidious dry "
cough that's most pronounced in the morning —appear. Progression to the advanced stage causes 
"dyspnea on minimal exertion, worsening cough, and pulmonary hypertension, which in turn  leads to "
"rightsided heart failure and cor pulmonale. Patients with silicosis have a high incidence of active TB, "
which should be considered when evaluating patients with this disease. Central nervous system 
"changes —confusion, lethargy, and a decrease in the rate and depth of respiration as the partial "
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide increases —also occur in advanced silicosis. Other clinical features 
"include malaise, disturbed sleep, and hoarseness. The severity of these symptoms may not correlate "
with  chest X -ray findings or the results of pulmonary function tests.  
Asbestosis  
Clinical features may appear before chest X -ray changes. The first symptom is usually dyspnea on 
"exertion, typically after 10 years' exposure. As fibrosis extends, dyspnea on exertion increases until, "
"eventually, dyspnea occurs even at rest. Advanced disease also causes a dry cough (may be "
"productive in smokers), chest pain (commonly pleuritic), recurrent respiratory infections, and "
"tachypnea. Cardiovascular complications inclu de pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular "
"hypertrophy, and cor pulmonale. Finger clubbing commonly occurs.  "
Coal worker's pneumoconiosis  
"Simple CWP produces no symptoms, especially in nonsmokers. Symptoms of complicated CWP "
include exertional dyspnea  and a cough that occasionally produces inky -black sputum (when fibrotic 
changes undergo avascular necrosis and their centers cavitate). Other clinical features of CWP 
"include increasing dyspnea and a cough that produces milky, gray, clear, or coalflecked  sputum. "
"Recurrent bronchial and pulmonary infections produce yellow, green, or thick sputum. "
"Complications include pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy and cor pulmonale, "
"and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). In cigarette smokers, chronic bron chitis and emphysema may also "
complicate the disease.  
 
Impetigo  
Common nonbullous impetigo typically begins with a small red macule that turns into a vesicle or 
"pustule. When the vesicle breaks, a thick yellow crust forms from the exudate. (See Recognizing "
"impetigo, page 736.) Autoinoculation may cause satellite lesions. Although it can occur anywhere, "
impetigo usually occurs around the mouth and nose and on the knees and elbows. Other features 
"include pruritus, burning, and regional lymphadenopathy. A rare but serious com plication of "
"streptococcal impetigo is glomerulonephritis, which is more likely to occur when many members of "
the same family have impetigo.  
"Folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis  "
"Pustules of folliculitis usually appear in a hair follicle on the  scalp, arms, and legs in children; on the "
face of bearded men (sycosis barbae); and on the eyelids (styes). Deep folliculitis may be painful. 
"Folliculitis may progress to the hard, painful nodules of furunculosis, which commonly develop on the "
"neck, face,  axillae, and buttocks. For several days these nodules enlarge, and then rupture, discharging "
"pus and necrotic material. After the nodules rupture, pain subsides, but erythema and edema may "
"persist for days or weeks. Carbunculosis is marked by extremely pa inful, deep abscesses that drain "
"through multiple openings onto the skin surface, usually around several hair follicles. Fever and "
malaise may accompany these lesions.  
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome  
"SSSS can usually be traced to a prodromal upper  respiratory tract infection, possibly with concomitant "
"purulent conjunctivitis. Cutaneous changes progress through three stages: Erythema: Erythema, "
"which may begin diffusely or as a scarlatiniform rash, usually becomes visible around the mouth and "
other orifices and may spread in widening circles over the entire body surface. The skin becomes 
tender; Nikolsky's sign (sloughing of the skin when friction is applied) may appear. Exfoliation (24 to 
"48 hours later): In the more common, localized form of this d isease, superficial erosions with a red, "
"moist base and minimal crusting occur, generally around body orifices, and may spread to exposed "
"areas of the skin. (See Identifying staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, page 740.) In the more severe "
"forms of this disease, large, flaccid bullae erupt and may spread to cover extensive areas of the body. "
"These bullae eventually rupture, revealing sections of denuded skin; mucous membranes are spared. "
"Desquamation: In this final stage, affected areas dry up, and powder y scales form. Normal skin "
replaces these scales in 5 to 7 days.  
Tinea versicolor  
"Tinea versicolor typically produces raised or macular, round or oval, slightly scaly lesions on the upper "
"trunk, which may extend to the lower abdomen, neck, arms, groin,  thigh, genitalia and, rarely, the "
face. These lesions are usually tawny but may range from hypopigmented (white) patches in dark -
skinned patients to hyperpigmented (brown) patches in fair -skinned patients. Some areas don't tan 
"when exposed to sunlight, ca using the cosmetic defect for which most people seek medical help. "
"Inflammation, burning, and itching are possible but usually absent.  "
Dermatophytosis  
"Lesions vary in appearance depending on the site of invasion (inside or outside the hair shaft), dura tion "
"of infection, level of host resistance, and amount of inflammatory response. Tinea capitis ranges in "
"appearance from broken -off hairs with little scaling to severe painful, inflammatory, pus -filled masses "
(kerions) covering the entire scalp. Partial h air loss occurs in all cases. The cardinal clue is broken -off 
"hairs. Tinea corporis produces flat lesions on the skin at any site except the scalp, bearded skin, hands, "
"or feet. These lesions may be dry and scaly or moist and crusty; as they enlarge, their  centers heal, "
"causing the classic ring -shaped appearance. In tinea unguium (onychomycosis), infection typically "
starts at the tip of one or more toenails (fingernail infection is less common) and produces gradual 
"thickening, discoloration, and crumbling o f the nail, with accumulation of subungual debris. "
"Eventually, the nail may be destroyed completely. Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, causes scaling and "
"blisters between the toes. Severe infection may result in inflammation, with severe itching and pain "
"on walking. A dry, squamous inflammation may affect the entire sole. (See Athlete's foot.) Tinea "
manuum produces scaling patches and hyperkeratosis on the palmar surface. It's usually unilateral 
"and associated with tinea pedis. Tinea cruris (jock itch) produc es red, raised, sharply defined, itchy or "
"burning lesions in the groin that may extend to the buttocks, inner thighs, and the external genitalia. "
"Warm weather, obesity, and tight clothing encourage fungus growth. Tinea barbae is an uncommon "
infection that affects the bearded facial area of men.  
Scabies  
"Typically, scabies causes itching, which intensifies at night . Characteristic lesions are usually excoriated "
and may appear as erythematous nodules. These threadlike lesions are approximately 1 cm long and 
"generally occur between fingers, on flexor surfaces of the wrists, on elbows, in axillary folds, at the "
"waistli ne, on nipples and buttocks in females, and on genitalia in males.  "
Cutaneous larva migrans  
"A transient rash, tingling, or, possibly, a small vesicle appears at the point of penetration, usually on "
"an exposed area that has come in contact with the groun d, such as the feet, legs, or buttocks. The "
incubation period is typically 1 to 6 days. The parasite may be active almost as soon as it enters the 
"skin. Local pruritus begins within hours following penetration. As the parasite migrates, it etches a "
"noticea ble thin, raised, red line on the skin, which may become vesicular and encrusted. Pruritus "
"quickly develops, often with crusting and secondary infection following excoriation. Onset is usually "
"characterized by slight itching that develops into intermittent  stinging pain as the thin, red lines "
develop. The larva's apparently random path can cover from 1 mm to 1 cm a day. Penetration of more 
"than one larva may involve a much larger area of the skin, marking it with many tracks.  "
Pediculosis  
"Clinical features of pediculosis capitis include itching; excoriation (with severe itching); matted, foul -"
"smelling, lusterless hair (in severe cases); occipital and cervical lymphadenopathy (posterior cervical "
"lymphadenopathy without obvious disease is cha racteristic); and a rash on the trunk, probably due to "
"sensitization. Adult lice migrate from the scalp and deposit oval, gray -white nits on the proximal one -"
"third of hair shafts. Pediculosis corporis initially produces small, red papules (usually on the s houlders, "
"trunk, or buttocks). Later, wheals (probably a sensitivity reaction) may develop. Untreated pediculosis "
"corporis may lead to vertical excoriations and ultimately to dry, discolored, thickly encrusted, scaly "
"skin, with bacterial infection and scar ring. In severe cases, headache, fever, and malaise may "
"accompany cutaneous symptoms. Pediculosis pubis causes skin irritation from scratching, which is "
usually more obvious than the bites. Small gray -blue spots (maculae caeruleae) may appear on the 
thighs  or upper body. Small red spots are often seen in the underclothing.  
Acne vulgaris  
"The acne plug may appear as a closed comedo, or whitehead (if it doesn't protrude from the follicle "
"and is covered by the epidermis), or as an open comed o, or blackhead (if it does protrude and isn't "
covered by the epidermis). The black coloration is caused by the melanin or pigment of the follicle. 
Rupture or leakage of an enlarged plug into the dermis produces inflammation and characteristic acne 
"pustule s, papules or, in severe forms, acne cysts or abscesses.  "
Hirsutism  
Hirsutism typically produces enlarged hair follicles as well as enlargement and hyperpigmentation of 
the hairs themselves. Excessive facial hair growth is the complaint for which most p atients seek 
"medical help. Generally, hirsutism involves appearance of thick, pigmented hair in the beard area, "
"upper back, shoulders, sternum, axillae, and pubic area. Frontotemporal scalp hair recession is often "
"a coexisting condition. Patterns of hirsut ism vary widely, depending on the patient's race and age. "
ELDER TIP Elderly women commonly show increased hair growth on the chin and upper lip. In 
"secondary hirsutism, signs of masculinization may appear —eepening of the voice, increased muscle "
"mass, incre ased size of genitalia, menstrual irregularity, and decreased breast size  "
Alopecia  
"In male -pattern alopecia, hair loss is gradual and usually affects the thinner, shorter, and less "
"pigmented hairs of the frontal and parietal portions of the scalp. In w omen, hair loss is generally more "
diffuse; completely bald areas are uncommon but may occur. Alopecia areata affects small patches of 
"the scalp but may also occur as alopecia totalis, which involves the entire scalp and eyebrows, or as "
"alopecia universalis , which involves the entire body. Although mild erythema may occur initially, "
"affected areas of scalp or skin appear normal. “Exclamation point” hairs (loose hairs with dark, rough, "
"brushlike tips on narrow, less pigmented shafts) occur at the periphery of  new patches. Regrowth hairs "
"are thin and may be white or gray. They're usually replaced by normal hair. In trichotillomania, patchy, "
incomplete areas of hair loss with many broken hairs appear on the scalp but may occur on other 
areas such as the eyebrows . 
Rosacea  
"Rosacea generally begins with periodic flushing across the central ov al of the face, accompanied later "
"by telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and nodules. Rhinophyma is commonly associated with severe "
untreated rosacea but may occur alone. Rhinophyma usually appears first on the lower half of the 
"nose, and produces red, thic kened skin and follicular enlargement. It's found almost exclusively in men "
older than age 40. Related ocular lesions are uncommon.  
Vitiligo  
"Vitiligo produces depigmented or stark -white patches on the skin; on fairskinned whites, these are "
"almost impe rceptible. Lesions are usually bilaterally symmetrical with sharp borders, which "
occasionally are hyperpigmented. Lesions that are small initially can enlarge and even progress to total 
depigmentation (universal vitiligo). These unique patches generally ap pear over bony prominences on 
"the back of the hands; on the face, the axillae, genitalia, nipples, or umbilicus; around orifices (such as "
"the eyes, mouth, and anus); within P body folds; and at sites of trauma. The hair within these lesions "
"may also turn w hite. Because hair follicles and certain parts of the eyes also contain pigment cells, "
vitiligo may be associated with premature gray hair and ocular pigmentary changes.  
Melasma  
"Typically, melasma produces large, brown, irregular patches, symmetrically distributed on the "
"forehead, cheeks, and sides of the nose. Less commonly, these patches may occur on the neck, upper "
"lip, temples and, occasionally, on the dorsa of the forearms.  "
Photosensitivity reactions  
"Immediately after sun exposure,  a phototoxic reaction causes a burning sensation followed by "
"erythema (sunburn -type reaction), edema, desquamation, and hyperpigmentation. Berlock dermatitis "
produces an acute reaction with erythematous vesicles that later become hyperpigmented. 
"Photoalle rgic reactions may take one of two forms. Developing 2 hours to 5 days after light exposure, "
"polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) produces erythema, papules, vesicles, urticaria, and eczematous "
lesions on exposed areas; pruritus may persist for 1 to 2 weeks.  Solar urticaria begins minutes after 
exposure and lasts about an hour; erythema and wheals follow itching and burning sensations.  
Dermatitis  
Atopic skin lesions generally begin as erythematous areas on excessively dry skin. PEDIATRIC TIP In 
"children, lesions typically appear on the forehead, cheeks, and extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. "
"In adults, lesions appear at flexion points (antecubital fossa, popliteal area, and neck). During flare -"
"ups, pruritus and scratching cause edema, crusting, and sc aling. Eventually, chronic atopic lesions lead "
"to multiple areas of dry, scaly skin, with white dermatographia, blanching, and lichenification. "
"Common secondary conditions associated with atopic dermatitis include viral, fungal, or bacterial "
"infections, an d ocular disorders. Because of intense pruritus, the upper eyelid is commonly "
"hyperpigmented and swollen, and a double fold occurs under the lower lid (Morgan -Dennie folds, "
"Morgan folds, Dennie pleats, or Mongolian lines). Atopic cataracts are unusual but may develop "
"between ages 20 and 40. Kaposi's varicelliform eruption, a potentially fatal, generalized viral infection, "
may develop if the patient with atopic dermatitis comes in contact with a person who's infected with 
herpes simplex.  
Toxic epidermal ne crolysis  
"Early symptoms include inflammation of the mucous membranes, a burning sensation in the "
"conjunctivae, malaise, fever, and generalized skin tenderness. After such prodromal symptoms, TEN "
"erupts in three phases: diffuse, erythematous rash vesicula tion and blistering large -scale epidermal "
"necrolysis and desquamation. Large, flaccid bullae that rupture easily expose extensive areas of "
"denuded skin, permitting both loss of tissue fluids and electrolytes and widespread systemic "
involvement.  
Warts  
"Clinical manifestations depend on the type of wart and its location: common (verruca vulgaris): rough, "
"elevated, rounded surface; appears most frequently on extremities, particularly hands and fingers; "
most prevalent in children and young adults condyloma a cuminatum (moist wart or genital wart): 
"usually small, pink to red, moist, and soft; may occur singly or in large cauliflower -like clusters on the "
"penis, scrotum, vulva, cervix, vagina, and anus; can also occur on oral mucosa following oral -genital "
"exposur e; considered a sexually transmitted disease digitate: fingerlike, horny projection arising from "
"a pea -shaped base; occurs on scalp or near hairline filiform: single, thin, threadlike projection; "
commonly occurs around the face and neck P flat (also known as juvenile or verruca plana): multiple 
"groupings of up to several hundred slightly raised lesions with smooth, flat, or slightly rounded tops; "
"common on the face, neck, chest, knees, dorsa of hands, wrists, and flexor surfaces of the forearms; "
usually occ ur in children but can affect adults; often linear distribution because of spread from 
"scratching or shaving periungual: rough, irregularly shaped, elevated surface; occurs around edges of "
"fingernails and toenails; when severe, may extend under nail and li ft it off nail bed, causing pain "
"plantar: slightly elevated or flat; occur singly or in large clusters (mosaic warts), primarily at pressure "
points of feet.  
Psoriasis  
"The most common complaint of the patient with psoriasis is itching and, occasionally,  pain from dry, "
"cracked, encrusted lesions. Psoriatic lesions are erythematous and usually form well -defined plaques, "
sometimes covering large areas of the body. (See Psoriatic plaques.) Such lesions most commonly 
"appear on the scalp, chest, elbows, knees,  shins, back, and buttocks. The plaques consist of "
"characteristic silver scales that either flake off easily or can thicken, covering the lesion. Removal of "
"psoriatic scales frequently produces fine bleeding points (Auspitz sign). Occasionally, small gutta te "
"lesions appear, either alone or with plaques; these lesions are typically thin and erythematous, with "
few scales. Widespread shedding of scales is common in exfoliative or erythrodermic psoriasis and 
"may also develop in chronic psoriasis. Rarely, psoria sis becomes pustular, taking one of two forms. In "
"localized pustular (Barber's) psoriasis, pustules appear on the palms and soles and remain sterile until "
"opened. In generalized pustular (von Zumbusch's) psoriasis, which often occurs with fever, "
"leukocytos is, and malaise, groups of pustules coalesce to form lakes of pus on red skin. These pustules "
also remain sterile until opened and commonly involve the tongue and oral mucosa. In about 30% of 
"patients, psoriasis spreads to the fingernails, producing small indentations and yellow or brown "
"discoloration. In severe cases, the accumulation of thick, crumbly debris under the nail, causes it to "
separate from the nail bed. Some patients with psoriasis develop arthritic symptoms (psoriatic 
"arthritis), usually in on e or more joints of the fingers or toes, or sometimes in the sacroiliac joints, "
which may progress to spondylitis. Such patients may complain of morning stiffness. Joint symptoms 
show no consistent linkage to the course of the cutaneous manifestations of p soriasis; they 
demonstrate remissions and exacerbations similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis.  
Lichen planus  
Lichen planus may develop suddenly or insidiously. Initial lesions commonly appear on the arms or 
legs (generally on the wrist and medial si des of the thighs) and evolve into the generalized eruption of 
"flat, glistening, purple papules marked with white lines or spots (Wickham's striae). These lesions may "
be linear from scratching or may coalesce into plaques. Lesions often affect the mucous m embranes 
"(especially the buccal mucosa), male genitalia and, less often, the nails. These lesions are painful, "
especially when ulcers develop. Mild to severe pruritus is common.  
Corns and calluses  
Both corns and calluses cause pain through pressure placed on underlying tissue by localized 
"thickened skin. Corns contain a central keratinous core, are smaller and more clearly defined than "
"calluses, and are usually more painful. The pain they cause may be dull and constant or sharp when "
pressure is applied. “Soft” corns are caused by the pressure of a bony prominence. They appear as 
"whitish thickenings and are commonly found between the toes, most often in the fourth interdigital "
"web. “Hard” corns are sh arply delineated and conical, and appear most frequently over the "
dorsolateral aspect of the fifth toe. Calluses have indefinite borders and may be quite large. They 
"usually produce dull pain on pressure, rather than constant pain. Although calluses common ly appear "
"over plantar warts, they're distinguished from these warts by normal skin markings.  "
Pityriasis rosea  
"Pityriasis typically begins with an erythematous “herald” patch, which may appear anywhere on the "
"body, although it occurs most commonly on t he trunk. Although this slightly raised, oval lesion is about "
"2 to 6 cm in diameter, approximately 25% of patients don't notice it. A few days to several weeks later, "
yellow -tan or erythematous patches with scaly edges (about 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter) erupt  on the 
"trunk and extremities —and, rarely, on the face, hands, and feet in adolescents. Eruption continues for "
"7 to 10 days, and the patches persist for 2 to 6 weeks. Occasionally, these patches are macular, "
"vesicular, or urticarial. A characteristic of th is disease is the arrangement of lesions, which produces a "
"pattern similar to that of a pine tree. Accompanying pruritus, if present, is usually mild but may be "
severe.  
Hyperhidrosis  
Axillary hyperhidrosis frequently produces such extreme sweating that  patients often ruin their 
"clothes in 1 day and develop contact dermatitis from clothing dyes; similarly, hyperhidrosis of the soles "
can easily damage a pair of shoes. Profuse sweating from both the soles and palms hinders the 
patient's ability to work and  interact socially. Patients with this condition often report increased 
emotional strain.  
Pressure ulcers  
Pressure ulcers commonly develop over bony prominences. Early features of superficial lesions are 
"shiny, erythematous changes over the compressed area, caused by localized vasodilation when "
"pressure is relieved. Superficial erythema progresses to small blisters or erosions and, ultimately, to "
necrosis and ulceration. An inflamed area on the skin's surface may be the first sign of underlying 
damage w hen pressure is exerted between deep tissue and bone. Bacteria in a compressed site cause 
"inflammation and, eventually, infection, which leads to further necrosis. A foul -smelling, purulent "
"discharge may seep from a lesion that penetrates the skin from ben eath. Infected, necrotic tissue "
prevents healthy granulation of scar tissue; a black eschar may develop around and over the lesion.
