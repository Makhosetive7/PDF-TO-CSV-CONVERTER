      "purulent drainage in the ear canal from tympanic membrane rupture. However, many patients are \n",
      "asymptomatic.Acute secretory otitis media produces a severe conductive hearing loss—which varies \n",
      "from 15 to 35 dB, depending on the thickness and amountof fluid in the middle ear cavity—and, \n",
      "possibly, a sensation of fullness in  the ear and popping, crackling,  or clicking sounds on swallowing or \n",
      "with jaw movement. Accumulation of  fluid may also cause the patient to hear an echo when he speaks \n",
      "and to experience a vague feeling of top-heaviness.The cumulative effects of chronic otitis media include \n",
      "thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent tympanic  membrane mobility, \n",

      "Mastoiditis\n",
      "Primary clinical features include a dull ache and tenderness in the area  of the mastoid process, low-\n",
      "grade fever, headache, and a thick, purulent  discharge that gradually becomes more profuse, possibly \n",
      "leading to otitis externa. Postauricular erythema and edema may push the auricle out  from the head; \n",
      "pressure within the edematous mastoid antrum may  produce swelling and obstruction of the external \n",
      "ear canal, causing conductive hearing loss.\n",
      "Otosclerosis\n",
      "Spongy bone in the otic capsule immobilizes the footplate of the  normally mobile stapes, disrupting the \n",
      "conduction of vibrations from the  tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This causes progressive unilateral  \n",

      "Willis (hearing conversation better in a  noisy environment than in a quiet one).\n",
      "Infectious myringitis\n",
      "Acute infectious myringitis begins with severe ear pain, commonly  accompanied by tenderness over the \n",
      "mastoid process. Small, reddened,  inflamed blebs form in the canal, on the tympanic membrane and, \n",
      "with bacterial invasion, in the middle ear. Fever and hearing loss are rare  unless fluid accumulates in the \n",
      "middle ear, or a large bleb totally  obstructs the external auditory meatus. Spontaneous rupture of these  \n",
      "blebs may cause bloody discharge. Chronic granular myringitis produces  pruritus, purulent discharge, \n",
      "and gradual hearing loss.\n",
      "Ménière's disease\n",
      "Ménière's disease produces three characteristic effects: severe episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and \n",
      "sensorineural hearing loss. A feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear is also common. Violent \n",
      "paroxysmal attacks last from 10 minutes to several hours. During an acute attack, other symptoms \n",
      "include severe nausea, vomiting, sweating, giddiness, and nystagmus. Vertigo may cause loss of balance \n",
      "and falling to the affected side. Symptoms tend to wax and wane as the endolymphatic pressure rises \n",
      "and falls. To lessen these symptoms, the patient may assume a characteristic posture—lying on the side \n",
      "of the unaffected ear and  looking in the direction of the affected ear.  Initially, the patient may be \n",
      "asymptomatic between attacks, except for  residual tinnitus that worsens during an attack. Such attacks \n",
      "may occur several times a year, or remissions may last as long as several years.  These attacks become \n",
      "less frequent as hearing loss progresses (usually  unilaterally); they may cease when hearing loss is total. \n",
      "All symptoms are aggravated by motion.\n",
      "Labyrinthitis\n",
      "Because the inner ear controls both hearing and balance, this infection  typically produces severe vertigo \n",
      "(with any movement of the head) and  sensorineural hearing loss. Vertigo begins gradually but peaks \n",
      "within 48 hours, causing loss of balance and falling in the direction of the affected  ear. Other associated \n",
      "signs and symptoms include spontaneous  nystagmus, with jerking movements of the eyes toward the \n",
      "unaffected ear, and nausea, vomiting, and giddiness. With cholesteatoma, signs of  middle ear disease \n",
      "may appear. With severe bacterial infection, purulent  drainage, increased salivation, generalized malaise,\n",
      "and perspiration can  occur. To minimize symptoms such as giddiness and nystagmus, the  patient may \n",

      "the affected ear.\n",
      "Hearing loss\n",
      "Sudden deafness may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed, depending  on etiology. Associated clinical \n",
      "features depend on the underlying cause.  Noise-induced hearing loss causes sensorineural damage, the \n",
      "extent of which depends on the duration and intensity of the noise. Initially, the  patient loses perception \n",
      "of certain frequencies (around 4,000 Hz) but,  with continued exposure, eventually loses perception of all \n",
      "frequencies.\n",
      "Motion sickness\n",
      "Typically, motion sickness induces nausea, vomiting, headache,dizziness, fatigue, diaphoresis and, \n",
      "occasionally, difficulty in breathing,leading to a sensation of suffocation. These symptoms usually subside\n",
      "when the precipitating stimulus is removed, but they may persist for  several hours or days.\n",
      "Epistaxis\n",
      "Blood oozing from the nostrils usually originates in the anterior nose and  is bright red. Blood from the \n",
      "back of the throat originates in the  posterior area and may be dark or bright red (commonly mistaken for\n",
      "hemoptysis due to expectoration).  Epistaxis is generally unilateral, except when it's due to dyscrasia or  \n",
      "severe trauma. In severe epistaxis, blood may seep behind the nasal  septum; it may also appear in the \n",
      "middle ear and in the corners of the  eyes. Associated clinical effects depend on the severity of bleeding. \n",
      "Moderate blood loss may produce light-headedness, dizziness, and slight  respiratory difficulty; severe \n",
      "hemorrhage causes hypotension, rapid and  bounding pulse, dyspnea, and pallor. Bleeding is considered \n",
      "severe if it persists longer than 10 minutes after pressure is applied and causes  blood loss as great as 1 \n",
      "L/hour in adults. Exsanguination (bleeding to  death) from epistaxis is rare.\n",
      "Septal perforation and deviation\n",
      "A small septal perforation is usually asymptomatic but may produce a  whistle on inspiration. A large \n",
      "perforation causes rhinitis, epistaxis,  nasal crusting, and watery discharge.The patient with a deviated \n",
      "septum may develop a crooked nose, as the  midline deflects to one side. The predominant symptom of \n",
      "severe deflection, however, is nasal obstruction. Other manifestations include a  sensation of fullness in \n",
      "the face, shortness of breath, stertor (snoring or  laborious breathing), nasal discharge, recurring \n",
      "epistaxis, infection, sinusitis, and headache.\n",
      "Sinusitis\n",
      "The primary indication of acute sinusitis is nasal congestion, followed by  a gradual buildup of pressure in \n",
      "the affected sinus. For 24 to 48 hours  after onset, nasal discharge may be present and later may become  \n",
      "purulent. Associated symptoms include malaise, sore throat, headache,and low-grade fever of 99° to \n",
      "99.5° F [37.2° to 37.5° C]).Characteristic pain depends on the affected sinus: maxillary sinusitis causes \n",
      "pain over the cheeks and upper teeth; ethmoid sinusitis, pain over the eyes; frontal sinusitis, pain over \n",
      "the eyebrows; and sphenoid sinusitis (rare), pain behind the eyes. (See Locating the paranasal sinuses.) \n",
      "Purulent nasal drainage that continues for longer than 3 weeks after an acute infection subsides suggests\n",
      "subacute sinusitis. Other clinical features of the subacute form include nasal congestion, vague facial \n",
      "discomfort, fatigue, and a nonproductive cough. The effects of chronic sinusitis are similar to those of \n",
      "acute sinusitis, but the chronic form causes continuous mucopurulent discharge.\n",
      "Nasal polyps\n",
      "Nasal obstruction is the primary indication of nasal polyps. Such obstruction causes anosmia, a sensation\n",
      "of fullness in the face, nasal discharge, headache, and shortness of breath. Associated clinical features \n",
      "are usually the same as those of allergic rhinitis.\n",
      "Nasal papillomas\n",
      "Both inverted and exophytic papillomas typically produce symptoms related to unilateral nasal \n",
      "obstruction—congestion, postnasal drip,headache, shortness of breath, dyspnea and, rarely, severe \n",
      "respiratory distress, nasal drainage, and infection. Epistaxis is most likely to occur  with exophytic \n",
      "papillomas. Occasionally hemorrhage may be the  presenting symptom.\n",
      "Adenoid hyperplasia\n",
      "Typically, adenoid hyperplasia produces symptoms of respiratory  obstruction, especially mouth \n",
      "breathing, snoring at night, and frequent,  prolonged nasal congestion. Persistent mouth breathing during\n",
      "the formative years produces voice alteration and distinctive changes in  facial features—a slightly \n",
      "elongated face, open mouth, highly arched  palate, shortened upper lip, and vacant expression.\n",
      "Velopharyngeal insufficiency\n",
      "Generally, this condition causes unintelligible speech, marked by  hypernasality, nasal emission, poor \n",
      "consonant definition, and a weak  voice. The patient experiences dysphagia and, if velopharyngeal  \n",
      "insufficiency is severe, he may regurgitate through the nose.\n",
      "Pharyngitis\n",
      "Pharyngitis produces a sore throat and slight difficulty in swallowing.  Swallowing saliva is usually more \n",
      "painful than swallowing food.  Pharyngitis may also cause the sensation of a lump in the throat as well  as \n",
      "a constant, aggravating urge to swallow. Associated features may  include mild fever, headache, muscle \n",
      "and joint pain, coryza, and  rhinorrhea. Uncomplicated pharyngitis usually subsides in 3 to 10 days.\n",
      "Tonsillitis\n",
      "Acute tonsillitis commonly begins with a mild to severe sore throat. A  very young child, unable to \n",
      "describe a sore throat, may stop eating.Tonsillitis may also produce dysphagia, fever, swelling and \n",
      "tenderness of the lymph glands in the submandibular area, muscle and joint pain,  chills, malaise, \n",
      "headache, and pain (frequently referred to the ears).Excess secretions may elicit the complaint of a \n",
      "constant urge to swallow; the back of the throat may feel constricted. Such discomfort  usually subsides \n",
      "after 72 hours. Chronic tonsillitis produces a recurrent sore throat and purulent  drainage in the tonsillar \n",
      "crypts. Frequent attacks of acute tonsillitis may  also occur. Complications include obstruction from \n",
      "tonsillar hypertrophy  and peritonsillar abscess.\n",
      "Throat abscesses\n",
      "Key symptoms of peritonsillar abscess include severe throat pain,occasional ear pain on the same side as\n",
      "the abscess, and tenderness of  the submandibular gland. Dysphagia causes drooling. Trismus may occur  \n",
      "as a result of the spread of edema and infection from the peritonsillar  space to the pterygoid muscles. \n",
      "Other effects include fever, chills,malaise, rancid breath, nausea, muffled speech, dehydration, cervical  \n",
      "adenopathy, and localized or systemic sepsis.  Clinical features of retropharyngeal abscess include pain, \n",
      "dysphagia, fever and, when the abscess is located in the upper pharynx, nasal  obstruction; with a \n",
      "lowpositioned abscess, dyspnea, progressive  inspiratory stridor (from laryngeal obstruction), neck \n",
      "hyperextension and, in children, drooling and muffled crying occur. Other symptoms in children  may \n",
      "include gurgling respirations, dyspnea and dysphagia, respiratory  symptoms, and fever. A very large \n",
      "abscess may press on the larynx,  causing edema, or may erode into major vessels, causing sudden death  \n",
      "from asphyxia or aspiration.\n",
      "Vocal cord paralysis\n",
      "Unilateral paralysis, the most common form, may cause vocal weakness  and hoarseness. Bilateral \n",
      "paralysis typically produces vocal weakness  and incapacitating airway obstruction if the cords become \n",
      "paralyzed in the adducted position.\n",
      "Vocal cord nodules and polyps\n",
      "Nodules and polyps inhibit the approximation of vocal cords and produce  painless hoarseness. The voice \n",
      "may also develop a breathy or husky  quality\n",
      "Laryngitis\n",
      "Acute laryngitis typically begins with hoarseness, ranging from mild to  complete loss of voice. Associated\n",
      "clinical features include pain  (especially when swallowing or speaking), a persistent dry cough, fever,  \n",

      "Juvenile angiofibroma\n",
      "Juvenile angiofibroma produces unilateral or bilateral nasal obstruction  and severe recurrent epistaxis, \n",
      "usually between ages 7 and 21.  Recurrent epistaxis eventually causes secondary anemia. Associated  \n",
      "effects include purulent rhinorrhea, facial deformity, and nasal speech.  Serous otitis media and hearing \n",

      "Blepharitis  \n",
      " Clinical features of blepharitis include itching, burning, foreign-body sensation, and sticky, \n",
      "crusted eyelids on waking. This constant irritation results in unconscious rubbing of the eyes (cau sing \n",

      "scales on lashes, loss of lashes, and ulcerated areas on lid margins in ulcerative blepharitis. In associatio n \n",
      "with KCS, dry eyes may also be a problem.  \n",
      "Exophthalmos  \n",
      "The obvious effect is a bulging eyeball, commonly with diplopia, if extraocular muscle ed ema causes \n",
      "misalignment. (See Recognizing exophthalmos.) A rim of the sclera may be visible below the  upper lid as \n",
      "lid retraction occurs, and the patient may blink infrequently. Other symptoms depend on the cause: pain  \n",
      "may accompany traumatic exophthalmos; a tumor may produce conjunctival hyperemi a or chemosis; \n",
      "retraction of the upper lid predisposes to exposure keratitis. If exophthalmos is associated with \n",

      "pain, impaired eye movement, chemosis, and purulent discharge from indurated areas. The severity of \n",
      "associated systemic symptoms (chills, fever, and malaise) varies according to the cause. Com plications \n",
      "include posterior extension, causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, panophthalmitis, mening itis, or brain \n",

      "Dacryocystitis  \n",
      "Dacryocystitis is extremely painful for the patient. The hallmark of both the acute and chronic forms of \n",
      "dacryocystitis is constant tearing. Other symptoms of dacryocystitis include inflammation and \n",

      "Hemorrhoids  \n",
      "Although hemorrhoids may be asymptomatic, they characteristically cause painless, intermittent \n",
      "bleeding, which occurs on defecation. Bright red blood appears  on stool or on toilet paper due to \n",
      "injury of the fragile mucosa covering the hemorrhoid. These first -degree hemorrhoids may itch \n",

      "however, such systemic complications are rare.  \n",
      "Anorectal absces s and fistula  \n",
      "Characteristics are throbbing pain and tenderness at the site of the abscess. A hard, painful lump \n",
      "develops on one side, preventing comfortable sitting. Discharge of pus may occur from the rectum, \n",
      "and there may be constipation or pain assoc iated with bowel movements.  \n",
      "Rectal polyps  \n",
      "Because rectal polyps don't generally cause symptoms, they're usually discovered incidentally during \n",
      "a digital examination or rectosigmoidoscopy. Rectal bleeding is a common sign; high rectal polyps \n",

      "lobulated. They may grow large and cause  painful defecation; however, because adenomas are soft, \n",
      "they rarely cause bowel obstruction. Sometimes adenomas prolapse outside the anus, expelling \n",

      "Pilonidal disease  \n",
      "Generally, a pilonidal cyst produces no symptoms until it becomes infected, causing local pain, \n",

      "Rectal prolapse  \n",
      "In rectal prolapse, protrusion of tissue from the rectum may occur during defecation or walking. \n",
      "Other symptoms include a persistent sensation of rectal fullness, bloody diarrhea, pain in the lower \n",

      "Pruritus ani  \n",
      "The key symptom of pruritus a ni is perianal itching or burning after a bowel movement, during \n",
      "stress, or at night. In acute pruritus ani, scratching produces reddened skin, with weeping \n",
      "excoriations; in chronic pruritus ani, skin becomes thick and leathery, with excessive pigmentation . \n",
      "Proctitis  \n",
      "Key symptoms include tenesmus, constipation, a feeling of rectal fullness, and abdominal cramps on \n",

      "tumors (such as meningiomas), short stature, seizures, speech and learning disabilities, mental \n",
      "retardation (occasionally), and abnormalities of the cerebral, GI, and renal arteries. The first sign of NF- 2 \n",
      "is usually a central nervous system tumor, such as a spinal or intracranial meningioma, an acoustic \n",
      "neuroma, and occasionally a schwannoma or spinal astrocytoma. Cutaneous neurofibromas may be less \n",

      "opalescent dentin. Patients with dental abnormalities are shorter and have more fractures at birth, more \n",
      "frequent fractures, and more severe skeletal deformities than type I patients with normal teeth. Bowing \n",
      "of the lower limbs is common in this type, as is kyphosis in adults. About 40% of all adu lts with type I \n",
      "have severely impaired hearing, and virtually all adults have some degree of hearing impairment by age \n",
      "50. The number of fractures may spontaneously decrease in adolescence. \n",
      "Type II is characterized by intrauterine fractures due to extreme bone fragility, leading to intrauteri ne or \n",
      "early infant death. Death usually results from complications of bone fragility, heart failure, pu lmonary \n",
      "hypertension, or respiratory failure. Therapeutic intervention doesn't usually increase survival. Type III is \n",
      "generally nonlethal. Fractures are usually present at birth and occur frequently in childhood; they \n",
      "typically lead to progressive skeletal deformity and, eventually, impaired mobility. Pati ents have a poor \n",
      "growth rate; most fall below the third percentile in height for their age. Their sclerae are usually normal  \n",
      "or light blue, and their teeth aren't usually opalescent. Type IV is characterized by osteoporosis, which \n",
      "leads to increased bone fragility. The sclerae may be light blue at birth but appear normal in adolescents \n",
      "and adults. Bowed limbs may be present at birth, but only 25% of patients have fractures at birth. The \n",

      "Weakness of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules results in joints that are loose, hyperextensible, an d \n",
      "habitually dislocated. Excessive growth of the rib bones gives rise to chest deformities such as pectus \n",

      "displacement (ectopia lentis), the ocular hallmark of Marfan syndrome. Quivering of the iris with eye \n",
      "movement (iridodonesis) typically suggests this disorder. Most patients are severely myopic, m any have \n",
      "retinal detachment, and some have glaucoma. The most serious complications occur in the \n",
      "cardiovascular system and include weakness of the aortic media, which leads to progressive dilation o r \n",
      "dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Such dilation appears first in the coronary sinuses and i s \n",
      "commonly preceded by aortic insufficiency. Less-common cardiovascular complications inclu de mitral \n",

      "persons with a COL2AI mutation. Persons with Stickler's syndrome can also have congenital cataracts an d \n",
      "develop glaucoma. Ocular symptoms are typically absent in persons with linkage to COLIJA2. Auditory  \n",
      "symptoms include conductive hearing loss secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunctio n in children with \n",
      "cleft palate or collagen defects in the inner ear apparatus. Sensorineural hearing loss has an earlier onset \n",
      "and tends to be more progressive in persons with a COLIJAI mutation. Craniofacial features may include \n",

      "hyponatremia and hypochloremia and can eventually induce fatal shock and arrhythmias, especially in \n",
      "hot weather. Respiratory symptoms reflect obstructive changes in the lungs: wheezy respirations;  a dry, \n",
      "nonproductive paroxysmal cough; dyspnea; and tachypnea. These changes stem from thick , tenacious \n",
      "secretions in the bronchioles and alveoli and eventually lead to severe atelectasis and emphysema. \n",
      "Children with cystic fibrosis display a barrel chest, cyanosis, and clubbing of the fingers and  toes. They \n",
      "suffer recurring bronchitis and pneumonia as well as associated nasal polyps and sinusitis. Death \n",
      "typically results from pneumonia, emphysema, or atelectasis. The GI effects of cystic fibrosis occur \n",

      "absorption of fat and protein in the GI tract. The undigested food is then excreted in frequent, bulky, \n",
      "foul-smelling, pale stools with a high fat content. This malabsorption induces po or weight gain, poor \n",
      "growth, ravenous appetite, distended abdomen, thin extremities, and sallow skin with poor turgor. The \n",
      "inability to absorb fats results in a deficiency of fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), leading to clo tting \n",

      "Infection may develop after the crisis subsides (in 4 days to several weeks), so watch for lethargy, \n",
      "sleepiness, fever, or apathy. An aplastic crisis (megaloblastic crisis) results from bone marrow depression \n",
      "and is associated with infection, usually viral. It's characterized by pallor, lethargy, sleepiness, dyspnea, \n",
      "possible coma, markedly decreased bone marrow activity, and RBC hemolysis. In infants between  ages 8 \n",
      "months and 2 years, an acute sequestration crisis may cause sudden massive entrapment of RBCs in the \n",

      "dark or  bright red blood in the feces and mucus in or on the stools. With a rectal tumor, the \n",
      "first symptom is a change in bowel habits, in many cases beginning with an urgent need to \n",
      "defecate on arising (morning diarrhea) or obstipation alternating with diarrhea . Other signs \n",
      "are blood or mucus in stools and a sense of incomplete evacuation. Late in the disease, pain \n",
      "begins as a feeling of rectal fullness that later becomes a dull, and sometimes constant, ache \n",
      "confined to the rectum or sacral region.  \n",
      "Kidney cancer  \n",
      "Kidney cancer produces a classic clinical triad (hematuria, pain, and a palpable mass), but \n",
      "any one may be the first sign of cancer. Microscopic or gross hematuria (which may be \n",
      "intermittent) suggests that the cancer has spread to the renal  pelvis. Constant abdominal or \n",
      "flank pain may be dull or, if the cancer causes bleeding or blood clots, acute and colicky. The \n",
      "mass is generally smooth, firm, and nontender. All three signs coexist in only about 10% of \n",
      "patients. Other signs include fever ( perhaps from hemorrhage or necrosis), hypertension \n",
      "(from compression of the renal artery with renal parenchymal ischemia), rapidly progressing \n",
      "hypercalcemia (possibly from ectopic parathyroid hormone production by the tumor), and \n",
      "urine retention. Weight lo ss, edema in the legs, nausea, and vomiting signal advanced \n",
      "disease.  \n",
      "Liver cancer  \n",
      "Clinical effects of liver cancer include: a mass in the right upper quadrant tender, nodular \n",

      "veins dependent edema.  \n",
      "Bladder cancer  \n",
      "In early stages, about 25% of patients with bladder tumors have no symptoms. Commonly, \n",
      "the first sign is gross, painless, intermittent hematuria (in many cases with clots in the \n",
      "urine). M any patients with invasive lesions have suprapubic pain after voiding. Other signs \n",
      "and symptoms include bladder irritability, urinary frequency, nocturia, and dribbling.  \n",
      "Gallbladder and bile duct cancer  \n",
      "Clinically, gallbladder cancer is almost indistin guishable from cholecystitis —pain in the \n",
      "epigastrium or right upper quadrant, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. \n",
      "However, chronic, progressively severe pain in an afebrile patient suggests malignancy. In \n",
      "patients with simple gallstones,  pain is sporadic. Another telling clue to malignancy is \n",
      "palpable gallbladder (right upper quadrant), with obstructive jaundice. Some patients may \n",
      "also have hepatosplenomegaly. Progressive profound jaundice is commonly the first sign of \n",
      "obstruction due to extrahepatic bile duct cancer. The jaundice is usually accompanied by \n",
      "chronic pain in the epigastrium or the right upper quadrant, radiating to the back. Other \n",
      "common signs or symptoms, if associated with active cholecystitis, include pruritus, skin \n",
      "excori ations, anorexia, weight loss, chills, and fever.  \n",
      "Prostate cancer  \n",
      "Signs and symptoms of prostate cancer appear only in the advanced stages and include \n",
      "difficulty initiating a urine stream, dribbling, urine retention, unexplained cystitis and, rarely, \n",
      "hematuria. Pain may be present in the lower back, with urination, ejaculation, and bowel \n",
      "movement.  \n",
      "Testicular cancer  \n",
      "The first sign is usually a firm, painless, and smooth testicular mass, varying in size and \n",
      "sometimes producing a sense of testicular he aviness. When such a tumor causes chorionic \n",
      "gonadotropin or estrogen production, gynecomastia and nipple tenderness may result. In \n",
      "advanced stages, signs and symptoms include ureteral obstruction, abdominal mass, cough, \n",
      "hemoptysis, shortness of breath, wei ght loss, fatigue, pallor, and lethargy.  \n",
      "Penile cancer  \n",
      "In a circumcised man, early signs of penile cancer include a small circumscribed lesion, a \n",
      "pimple, or a sore on the penis. In an uncircumcised man, however, such early symptoms \n",
      "may go unnoticed, so  penile cancer first becomes apparent when it causes late -stage signs \n",
      "or symptoms, such as pain, hemorrhage, dysuria, purulent discharge, and obstruction of the \n",
      "urinary meatus. Rarely is metastasis the first sign of penile cancer.  \n",
      "Cervical cancer  \n",
      "Preinvasive cervical cancer produces no symptoms or other clinically apparent changes. \n",
      "Early invasive cervical cancer causes abnormal vaginal bleeding, persistent vaginal discharge, \n",
      "and postcoital pain and bleeding. In advanced stages, it causes pelvic pai n, vaginal leakage \n",
      "of urine and feces from a fistula, anorexia, weight loss, and anemia.  \n",
      "Uterine cancer  \n",
      "Uterine enlargement, and persistent and unusual premenopausal bleeding, or any \n",
      "postmenopausal bleeding, are the most common indications of uterine c ancer. The \n",
      "discharge may at first be watery and bloodstreaked, but it gradually becomes more bloody. \n",
      "Other signs or symptoms, such as pain and weight loss, don't appear until the cancer is well \n",
      "advanced.  \n",
      "Vaginal cancer  \n",
      "Commonly, the patient with vagina l cancer has experienced abnormal bleeding and \n",
      "discharge. Also, she may have a small or large, in many cases firm, ulcerated lesion in any \n",
      "part of the vagina. As the cancer progresses, it commonly spreads to the bladder (producing \n",
      "frequent voiding and blad der pain), the rectum (bleeding), vulva (lesion), pubic bone (pain), \n",
      "or other surrounding tissues.  \n",
      "Ovarian cancer  \n",
      "Typically, symptoms vary with the size of the tumor. An ovary may grow to considerable size \n",
      "before it produces overt symptoms. Occasionall y, in the early stages, ovarian cancer causes \n",
      "vague abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, and other mild GI disturbances. As it progresses, it \n",
      "causes urinary frequency, constipation, pelvic discomfort, distention, and weight loss. \n",
      "Tumor rupture, torsion, or inf ection may cause pain, which, in young patients, may mimic \n",
      "appendicitis. Granulosa cell tumors have feminizing effects (such as bleeding between \n",
      "periods in premenopausal women); conversely, arrhenoblastomas have virilizing effects. \n",
      "Advanced ovarian cancer causes ascites, rarely postmenopausal bleeding and pain, and \n",
      "symptoms relating to metastatic sites (most commonly pleural effusions).  \n",
      "Cancer of the vulva  \n",
      "In 50% of patients, cancer of the vulva begins with vulval pruritus, bleeding, or a small vulval \n",
      "mass (which may start as a small ulcer on the surface; eventually, it becomes infected and \n",
      "painful), so such symptoms call for immediate diagnostic evaluation. Seventy percent of \n",
      "lesions develop on the labia, but tumors can be found on the clitoris, Barthol in's P glands, \n",
      "and perineum. Less common indications include a mass in the groin or abnormal urination \n",
      "or defecation.  \n",
      "Fallopian tube cancer  \n",
      "Generally, early stage fallopian tube cancer produces no symptoms. Late -stage disease is \n",
      "characterized by an enl arged abdomen with a palpable mass, amber -colored vaginal \n",
      "discharge, excessive bleeding during menstruation or, at other times, abdominal cramps, \n",
      "frequent urination, bladder pressure, persistent constipation, weight loss, and unilateral \n",
      "colicky pain produc ed by hydrops tubae profluens. (This last symptom occurs when the \n",
      "abdominal end of the fallopian tube closes, causing the tube to become greatly distended \n",
      "until its accumulated P secretions suddenly overflow into the uterus.) Metastasis develops \n",
      "by local e xtension or by lymphatic spread to the abdominal organs or to the pelvic, aortic, \n",
      "and inguinal lymph nodes. Extra -abdominal metastasis is rare.  \n",
      "Primary malignant bone tumors  \n",
      "Bone pain is the most common indication of primary malignant bone tumors. It's  generally \n",
      "more intense at night; isn't usually associated with mobility. The pain is dull and usually \n",
      "localized, although it may be referred from the hip or spine and result in weakness or a limp. \n",
      "Another common sign is a mass or tumor. The tumor site may  be tender and may swell; the \n",
      "tumor itself is often palpable. Pathologic fractures are common. In late stages, patient may \n",
      "be cachectic, with fever and impaired mobility.  \n",
      "Multiple myeloma  \n",
      "The earliest indication of multiple myeloma is severe, constant back and rib pain that \n",
      "increases with exercise and may be worse at night. Arthritic symptoms may also occur: \n",
      "achiness, joint swelling, and tenderness, possibly from vertebral compression. Othe r effects \n",
      "include fatigue, fever, malaise, slight evidence of peripheral neuropathy (such as peripheral \n",
      "paresthesia), and pathologic fractures. As multiple myeloma progresses, symptoms of \n",
      "vertebral compression may become acute, accompanied by anemia, weigh t loss, thoracic \n",
      "deformities (ballooning), and loss of body height (5″ [12.7 cm] or more) due to vertebral \n",
      "collapse. Renal complications such as pyelonephritis (caused by tubular damage from large \n",
      "amounts of Bence Jones protein, hypercalcemia, and hyperuri cemia) may occur. Severe, \n",
      "recurrent infection such as pneumonia may follow damage to nerves associated with \n",
      "respiratory function.  \n",
      "Basal cell epithelioma  \n",
      "Three types of basal cell epithelioma occur: Noduloulcerative lesions usually occur on the \n",
      "face, pa rticularly the forehead, eyelid margins, and nasolabial folds. In early stages, these \n",
      "lesions are small, smooth, pinkish, and translucent papules. Telangiectatic vessels cross the \n",
      "surface, and the lesions are occasionally pigmented. As the lesions enlarge,  their centers \n",
      "become depressed and their borders become firm and elevated. Ulceration P and local \n",
      "invasion eventually occur. These ulcerated tumors, known as rodent ulcers, rarely \n",
      "metastasize; however, if untreated, they can spread to vital areas and beco me infected or \n",
      "cause massive hemorrhage if they invade large blood vessels. Superficial basal cell \n",
      "epitheliomas are multiple in many cases and commonly occur on the chest and back. \n",
      "They're oval or irregularly shaped, lightly pigmented plaques, with sharply  defined, slightly \n",
      "elevated threadlike borders. Due to superficial erosion, these lesions appear scaly and have \n",
      "small, atrophic areas in the center that resemble psoriasis or eczema. They're usually \n",
      "chronic and don't tend to invade other areas. Superficial  basal cell epitheliomas are related \n",
      "to ingestion of or exposure to arsenic -containing compounds. Sclerosing basal cell \n",
      "epitheliomas (morphea -like epitheliomas) are waxy, sclerotic, yellow to white plaques \n",
      "without distinct borders. Occurring on the head an d neck, sclerosing basal cell epitheliomas \n",
      "commonly look like small patches of scleroderma.  \n",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma  \n",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma commonly develops on the skin of the face, the ears, the dorsa of \n",
      "the hands and forearms, and other sun -damaged areas. Lesions on sun -damaged skin tend \n",
      "to be less invasive and less likely to metastasize than lesions on unexposed skin. Notable \n",
      "exceptions to this tendency are squamous cell lesions on the lower lip and the ears. P These \n",
      "are almost invariably markedly i nvasive metastatic lesions with a generally poor prognosis. \n",
      "Transformation from a premalignant lesion to squamous cell carcinoma may begin with \n",
      "induration and inflammation of the preexisting lesion. When squamous cell carcinoma arises \n",
      "from normal skin, the  nodule grows slowly on a firm, indurated base. If untreated, this \n",
      "nodule eventually ulcerates and invades underlying tissues. (See Staging squamous cell \n",
      "carcinoma, page 874.) Metastasis can occur to the regional lymph nodes, producing \n",
      "characteristic syste mic symptoms of pain, malaise, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia.  \n",
      "Malignant melanoma  \n",
      "Common sites for melanoma are on the head and neck in men, on the legs in women, and \n",
      "on the backs of persons exposed to excessive sunlight. Up to 70% arise from a preexi sting \n",
      "nevus. It rarely appears in the conjunctiva, choroid, pharynx, mouth, vagina, or anus. \n",
      "Suspect melanoma when any skin lesion or nevus enlarges, changes color, becomes \n",
      "inflamed or sore, itches, ulcerates, bleeds, undergoes textural changes, or shows s igns of \n",
      "surrounding pigment regression (halo nevus or vitiligo). (See Recognizing potentially \n",
      "malignant nevi, page 876.) Each type of melanoma has special characteristics: Superficial \n",
      "spreading melanoma, the most common, usually develops between ages 40 an d 50. Such a \n",
      "lesion arises on an area of chronic irritation. In women, it's most common between the \n",
      "knees and ankles; in Blacks and Asians, on the toe webs and soles (lightly pigmented areas \n",
      "subject to trauma). Characteristically, this melanoma has a red, white, and blue color over a \n",
      "brown or black background and an irregular, notched margin. Its surface is irregular, with \n",
      "small, elevated tumor nodules that may ulcerate and bleed. Horizontal growth may \n",
      "continue for many years; when vertical growth begins, p rognosis worsens. Nodular \n",
      "melanoma usually develops between ages 40 and 50, grows vertically, invades the dermis, \n",
      "and metastasizes early. Such a lesion is usually a polypoidal nodule, with uniformly dark \n",
      "discoloration (it may be grayish), and looks like a blackberry. Occasionally, this melanoma is \n",
      "fleshcolored, with flecks of pigment around its base (possibly inflamed). Lentigo maligna \n",
      "melanoma is relatively rare. It arises from a lentigo maligna on an exposed skin surface and \n",
      "usually occurs between ages 60  and 70. This lesion looks like a large (3 - to 6-cm) flat freckle \n",
      "of tan, brown, black, whitish, or slate color and has irregularly scattered black nodules on \n",
      "the surface. It develops slowly, usually over P many years, and eventually may ulcerate. This \n",
      "melanoma commonly develops under the fingernails, on the face, and on the back of the \n",
      "hands.  \n",
      "Kaposi's sarcoma  \n",
      "The initial sign of Kaposi's sarcoma is one or more obvious lesions in various shapes, sizes, \n",
      "and colors (ranging from red -brown to dark purple) appearing most commonly on the skin, \n",
      "buccal mucosa, hard and soft palates, lips, gums, tongue, tonsils, conjunctiva, and sclera. In \n",
      "advanced disease, the lesions may join, becoming one large plaque. Untreated lesions may \n",
      "appear as large, ulcerative masses.  Other signs and symptoms include: health history of \n",
      "AIDS pain (if the sarcoma advances beyond the early stages or if a lesion breaks down or \n",
      "impinges on nerves or organs) edema from lymphatic obstruction dyspnea (in cases of \n",
      "pulmonary involvement), wheezi ng, hypoventilation, and respiratory distress from bronchial \n",
      "blockage. The most common extracutaneous sites are the lungs and GI tract (esophagus, \n",
      "oropharynx, and epiglottis). Signs and symptoms of disease progression and metastasis \n",
      "include severe pulmonar y involvement and GI involvement leading to digestive problems.  \n",
      "Hodgkin's lymphoma  \n",
      "The first sign of Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of one of the cervical \n",
      "lymph nodes (but sometimes the axillary, mediastinal, or inguinal lymph nodes) , \n",
      "occasionally in a patient who gives a history of recent upper respiratory infection. In older \n",
      "patients, the first signs and symptoms may be nonspecific —persistent fever, night sweats, \n",
      "fatigue, P weight loss, and malaise. Rarely, if the mediastinum is ini tially involved, Hodgkin's \n",
      "lymphoma may produce respiratory symptoms. Another early and characteristic indication \n",
      "of Hodgkin's lymphoma is pruritus, which, although mild at first, becomes acute as the \n",
      "disease progresses. Other symptoms depend on the degree  and location of systemic \n",
      "involvement. Lymph nodes may enlarge rapidly, producing pain and obstruction, or enlarge \n",
      "slowly and painlessly for months or years. It isn't unusual to see the lymph nodes “wax and \n",
      "wane,” but they usually don't return to normal. S ooner or later, most patients develop \n",
      "systemic manifestations, including enlargement of retroperitoneal nodes and nodular \n",
      "infiltrations of the spleen, the liver, and bones. At this late stage other symptoms include \n",
      "edema of the face and neck, progressive a nemia, possible jaundice, nerve pain, and \n",
      "increased susceptibility to infection.  \n",
      "Non -Hodgkin's lymphoma  \n",
      "Usually, the first indication of non -Hodgkin's lymphoma is swelling of the lymph glands, \n",
      "enlarged tonsils and adenoids, and painless, rubbery nodes in the cervical supraclavicular \n",
      "areas. In children, these nodes are usually in the cervical region, and the disease causes \n",
      "dyspnea and coughing. As the lymphoma progresses, the patient develops symptoms \n",
      "specific to the area involved and systemic complaints  of fatigue, malaise, weight loss, fever, \n",
      "and night sweats.  \n",
      "Mycosis fungoides  \n",
      "The first sign of MF may be generalized erythroderma, possibly associated with itching. \n",
      "Eventually, MF evolves into varied combinations of infiltrated, thickened, or scaly pa tches, \n",
      "tumors, or ulcerations.  \n",
      "Acute leukemia  \n",
      "Signs of acute leukemia may be gradual or abrupt; they include high fever accompanied by \n",
      "thrombocytopenia and abnormal bleeding (such as nosebleeds), gingival bleeding, purpura, \n",
      "ecchymoses, petechiae, easy bruising after minor trauma, and prolonged menses. \n",
      "Nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as low -grade fever, weakness, and lassitude, may \n",
      "persist for days or months before visible symptoms appear. Other insidious signs and \n",
      "symptoms include pallor, chills, a nd recurrent infections. In addition, ALL, AML, and acute \n",
      "monoblastic leukemia may cause dyspnea, anemia, fatigue, malaise, tachycardia, \n",
      "palpitations, systolic ejection murmur, and abdominal or bone pain. Specific AML symptoms \n",
      "include local infections (lar yngitis, pharyngitis, meningitis) or septicemia. Joint arthralgias \n",
      "and abdominal fullness (from enlarged spleen) may occur. Specific ALL symptoms include \n",
      "night sweats, shortness of breath, anorexia, weight loss, kepatosplenomegaly, and lymph \n",
      "adenopathy. Wh en leukemic cells cross the blood -brain barrier and thereby escape the \n",
      "effects of systemic chemotherapy, the patient may develop meningeal leukemia (confusion, \n",

      "calculi or gouty arthritis from increased uric acid excretion; occasionally, prolonged infection \n",
      "and ankle edema; and, rarely, priapism and vascular insufficiency. Acceleration of the \n",
      "disease process re sults in fever, night sweats, splenomegaly, and bone pain.  \n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia  \n",
      "CLL is the most benign and the most slowly progressive form of leukemia. Clinical signs \n",
      "derive from the infiltration of leukemic cells in bone marrow, lymphoid tiss ue, and organ \n",
      "systems. In early stages, patients usually complain of fatigue, malaise, fever, and nodal \n",
      "enlargement. They're particularly susceptible to infection. In advanced stages, patients may \n",
      "experience severe fatigue and weight loss, with liver or sp leen enlargement, bone \n",
      "tenderness, and edema from lymph node obstruction. Pulmonary infiltrates may appear \n",
      "when lung parenchyma is involved. Skin infiltrations, manifested by macular to nodular \n",
      "eruptions, occur in about one -half of the cases of CLL. As the  disease progresses, bone \n",
      "marrow involvement may lead to anemia, pallor, weakness, dyspnea, tachycardia, \n",
      "palpitations, bleeding, and infection. Opportunistic fungal, viral, and bacterial infections \n",
      "commonly occur in late stages  \n",
      "Cerebral palsy  \n",
      "Spastic cerebral palsy is characterized by hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, increased stretch reflexes, \n",
      "rapid alternating muscle contraction and relaxation, muscle weakness, underdevelopment of affected \n",
      "limbs, muscle contraction in response to manipulation, and a tendency to contractures. Typical ly, a child \n",
      "with spastic CP walks on his toes with a scissors gait, crossing one foot in front of the other. In athetoid \n",
      "cerebral palsy, involuntary movements —grimacing, wormlike writhing, dystonia, and sharp jerks —impair \n",
      "voluntary movement. Usually, these involuntary movements affect the arms more sever ely than the legs; \n",
      "involuntary facial movements may make speech difficult. These athetoid movements become m ore \n",
      "severe during stress, decrease with relaxation, and disappear entirely during sleep. Ataxic cerebral palsy \n",
      "is characterized by disturbed balance, incoordination (especially of the arms), hypoactive reflexes, \n",
      "nystagmus, muscle weakness, tremor, lack of leg movement during infancy, and a widebased gait as the \n",
      "child begins to walk. Ataxia makes sudden or fine movements almost impossible. Some children with CP \n",
      "display a combination of these clinical features. In most, impaired motor function makes eatin g \n",
      "(especially swallowing) difficult and retards growth and development. Up to 40% of these children are \n",
      "mentally retarded, about 25% have seizure disorders, and about 80% have impaired speech. Many als o \n",
      "have dental abnormalities, vision and hearing defects, and reading disabilities. \n",
      "Hydrocephalus  \n",
      "In infants, the unmistakable sign of hydrocephalus is rapidly increasing head circumference, clearly \n",
      "disproportionate to the infant's growth. Other characteristic changes include widening and bu lging of the \n",
      "fontanels; distended scalp veins; thin, shiny, and fragile-looking scalp skin; and underdeveloped ne ck \n",
      "muscles. (See Signs of hydrocephalus.) In severe hydrocephalus, the roof of the orbit is depressed, the \n",
      "eyes are displaced downward, and the sclerae are prominent. Sclera seen above the iris is called the \n",
      "“setting-sun sig n.” A high-pitched, shrill cry, abnormal muscle tone of the legs, irritability, anorexia, and \n",
      "projectile vomiting commonly occur. In adults and older children, indicators of hydrocephalu s include \n",
      "decreased level of consciousness (LOC), ataxia, incontinence, loss of coordination, and impaired intell ect.  \n",
      "Cerebral aneurysm  \n",
      "Occasionally, rupture of a cerebral aneurysm causes premonitory symptoms that last several days, such \n",
      "as headache, nuchal rigidity, stiff back and legs, and intermittent nausea. Usually, however, onset is \n",
      "abrupt and without warning, causing a sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting and, depending on \n",
      "the severity and location of bleeding, altered consciousness (including deep coma). Bleeding cau ses \n",
      "meningeal irritation, resulting in nuchal rigidity, back and leg pain, fever, restlessness, irritabilit y, \n",
      "occasional seizures, and blurred vision. Bleeding into the brain tissues causes hemiparesis, hemisensory \n",
      "defects, dysphagia, and visual defects. If the aneurysm is near the internal carotid artery, it compresses \n",
      "the oculomotor nerve and causes diplopia, ptosis, dilated pupil, and inability to rotate the e ye. The \n",
      "severity of symptoms varies considerably from patient to patient, depending on the site and amou nt of \n",
      "bleeding. To better describe their conditions, patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms are grouped as \n",
      "follows: \n",
      "Grade I (minimal bleed): Patient is alert with no neurologic deficit; he may have a slight headache and \n",

      "thickening, discoloration, and crumbling o f the nail, with accumulation of subungual debris. \n",
      "Eventually, the nail may be destroyed completely. Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, causes scaling and \n",

      "Alopecia  \n",
      "In male -pattern alopecia, hair loss is gradual and usually affects the thinner, shorter, and less \n",
      "pigmented hairs of the frontal and parietal portions of the scalp. In w omen, hair loss is generally more \n",
      "diffuse; completely bald areas are uncommon but may occur. Alopecia areata affects small patches of \n",

      "older than age 40. Related ocular lesions are uncommon.  \n",
      "Vitiligo  \n",
      "Vitiligo produces depigmented or stark -white patches on the skin; on fair\u0002skinned whites, these are \n",

      "may also turn w hite. Because hair follicles and certain parts of the eyes also contain pigment cells, \n",
      "vitiligo may be associated with premature gray hair and ocular pigmentary changes.  \n",
      "Melasma  \n",
      "Typically, melasma produces large, brown, irregular patches, symmetrically distributed on the \n",

      "Atopic skin lesions generally begin as erythematous areas on excessively dry skin. PEDIATRIC TIP In \n",
      "children, lesions typically appear on the forehead, cheeks, and extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. \n",
      "In adults, lesions appear at flexion points (antecubital fossa, popliteal area, and neck). During flare -\n",
      "ups, pruritus and scratching cause edema, crusting, and sc aling. Eventually, chronic atopic lesions lead \n",

      "Psoriasis  \n",
      "The most common complaint of the patient with psoriasis is itching and, occasionally,  pain from dry, \n",
      "cracked, encrusted lesions. Psoriatic lesions are erythematous and usually form well -defined plaques, \n",
      "sometimes covering large areas of the body. (See Psoriatic plaques.) Such lesions most commonly \n",
      "appear on the scalp, chest, elbows, knees,  shins, back, and buttocks. The plaques consist of \n",
      "characteristic silver scales that either flake off easily or can thicken, covering the lesion. Removal of \n",
      "psoriatic scales frequently produces fine bleeding points (Auspitz sign). Occasionally, small gutta te \n",
      "lesions appear, either alone or with plaques; these lesions are typically thin and erythematous, with \n",
      "few scales. Widespread shedding of scales is common in exfoliative or erythrodermic psoriasis and \n",
      "may also develop in chronic psoriasis. Rarely, psoria sis becomes pustular, taking one of two forms. In \n",
      "localized pustular (Barber's) psoriasis, pustules appear on the palms and soles and remain sterile until \n",
      "opened. In generalized pustular (von Zumbusch's) psoriasis, which often occurs with fever, \n",
      "leukocytos is, and malaise, groups of pustules coalesce to form lakes of pus on red skin. These pustules \n",
      "also remain sterile until opened and commonly involve the tongue and oral mucosa. In about 30% of \n",
      "patients, psoriasis spreads to the fingernails, producing small indentations and yellow or brown \n",
      "discoloration. In severe cases, the accumulation of thick, crumbly debris under the nail, causes it to \n",
      "separate from the nail bed. Some patients with psoriasis develop arthritic symptoms (psoriatic \n",
      "arthritis), usually in on e or more joints of the fingers or toes, or sometimes in the sacroiliac joints, \n",
      "which may progress to spondylitis. Such patients may complain of morning stiffness. Joint symptoms \n",
      "show no consistent linkage to the course of the cutaneous manifestations of p soriasis; they \n",
      "demonstrate remissions and exacerbations similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis.  \n",
      "Lichen planus  \n",
      "Lichen planus may develop suddenly or insidiously. Initial lesions commonly appear on the arms or \n",
      "legs (generally on the wrist and medial si des of the thighs) and evolve into the generalized eruption of \n",
      "flat, glistening, purple papules marked with white lines or spots (Wickham's striae). These lesions may \n",
      "be linear from scratching or may coalesce into plaques. Lesions often affect the mucous m embranes \n",
      "(especially the buccal mucosa), male genitalia and, less often, the nails. These lesions are painful, \n",

      "Corns and calluses  \n",
      "Both corns and calluses cause pain through pressure placed on underlying tissue by localized \n",
      "thickened skin. Corns contain a central keratinous core, are smaller and more clearly defined than \n",
      "calluses, and are usually more painful. The pain they cause may be dull and constant or sharp when \n",
      "pressure is applied. “Soft” corns are caused by the pressure of a bony prominence. They appear as \n",
      "whitish thickenings and are commonly found between the toes, most often in the fourth interdigital \n",
      "web. “Hard” corns are sh arply delineated and conical, and appear most frequently over the \n",
      "dorsolateral aspect of the fifth toe. Calluses have indefinite borders and may be quite large. They \n",

      "Pityriasis rosea  \n",
      "Pityriasis typically begins with an erythematous “herald” patch, which may appear anywhere on the \n",
      "body, although it occurs most commonly on t he trunk. Although this slightly raised, oval lesion is about \n",

      "yellow -tan or erythematous patches with scaly edges (about 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter) erupt  on the \n",
      "trunk and extremities —and, rarely, on the face, hands, and feet in adolescents. Eruption continues for \n",
      "7 to 10 days, and the patches persist for 2 to 6 weeks. Occasionally, these patches are macular, \n",
      "vesicular, or urticarial. A characteristic of th is disease is the arrangement of lesions, which produces a \n",
      "pattern similar to that of a pine tree. Accompanying pruritus, if present, is usually mild but may be \n",
      "severe.  \n",
      "Hyperhidrosis  \n",
      "Axillary hyperhidrosis frequently produces such extreme sweating that  patients often ruin their \n",
      "clothes in 1 day and develop contact dermatitis from clothing dyes; similarly, hyperhidrosis of the soles \n",
      "can easily damage a pair of shoes. Profuse sweating from both the soles and palms hinders the \n",
